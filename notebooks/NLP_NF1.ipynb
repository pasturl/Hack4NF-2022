(2007)} reported this mutation in 47 affected individuals from 21 unrelated families with a similar phenotype, lacking cutaneous neurofibromas or clinically obvious plexiform neurofibromas. One of the families had been reported by {90:Stevenson et al. (2006)}; another was reported by {17:Castle et al. (2003)} and had a diagnosis of Watson syndrome (WTSN; {193520}). The in-frame 3-bp deletion in exon 17 was predicted to result in the loss of 1 of 2 adjacent methionines, either codon 991 or codon 992, in conjunction with a silent ACA-to-ACG change of codon 990. These 2 methionine residues are located in a highly conserved region of neurofibromin and are expected, therefore, to have a functional role in the protein. This was said to have been the first study to correlate a specific small mutation of the NF1 gene with the expression of a particular clinical phenotype.\\n\\n{53:Koczkowska et al. (2019)} performed a standardized phenotypic assessment on 135 indivudals from 103 unrelated families carrying the NF1 p.Met992del mutation. None of the individuals had externally visible plexiform or histopathologically confirmed cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas. None had optic gliomas or symptomatic spinal neurofibromas; however, 4.8% of individuals had nonoptic brain tumors, mostly low-grade and asymptomatic, and 38.8% had cognitive impairment/learning disabilities. Of 119 patients evaluated, 15 (12.6%) had Noonan-like features. The authors concluded that NF patients carrying this variant have a mild NF1 phenotype lacking clinically suspected plexiform, cutaneous, or subcutaneous neurofibromas. However, learning difficulties are clearly part of the phenotypic presentation.',\n",

       " \"In a patient with severe neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; {162200}), {19:Colapietro et al. (2003)} found a G-to-A transition and a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide positions 57 and 58, respectively, of the 154-bp long NF1 exon 7, neither of which was present in the proband's parents or 50 healthy controls. RT-PCR analysis showed the expected fragment from exon 4b to 8 together with a shortened one with in-frame skipping of exon 7. Direct sequencing of genomic DNA revealed 2 exonic heterozygous changes at nucleotides 20075 (G-A transition) and 20076 (C-A transversion), which belong to contiguous codons. The first substitution occurred in the third base of the codon, changing it from CAG to CAA, both encoding glutamine (Q315Q); the second changed the CTG codon for leucine to the ATG codon for methionine (L316M). The use of previously established sequence matrices for the scoring of putative ESE motifs showed that the adjacent silent and missense mutations were located within highly conserved overlapping stretches of 7 nucleotides with a close similarity to the ESE-specific consensus sequences recognized by the SC35 ({600813}) and SF2/ASF ({600812}) arginine/serine-rich (SR) proteins. The combined occurrence of both consecutive alterations decreased the motif score for both SR proteins below their threshold levels. As the aberrant transcript was consistently expressed, a protein lacking 58 amino acids was predicted. Thus, the contiguous internal exon 7 mutations appear to have caused exon 7 skipping as a result of the missplicing caused by abrogation of functional ESEs (see {16:Cartegni et al. (2002)} and {30:Fairbrother et al. (2002)}). The male proband in the study of {19:Colapietro et al. (2003)} was the third child of healthy unrelated parents. At the age of 1 year, he underwent uronephrectomy because of right renal dysplasia. At the age of 3 years, an optic glioma was identified and surgically excised. The diagnosis of NF1 was made when he was 9 years old on the basis of the presence of cafe-au-lait spots, optic glioma, and Lisch nodules of the iris. Cerebral MRI at the age of 11 years revealed multiple hamartomas and a right hemisphere cerebral venous angioma. The patient showed borderline mental retardation, a height in the 10th percentile, and an occipitofrontal head circumference in the 97th percentile. At the age of 20 years, he showed macrocephaly, numerous cafe-au-lait spots, small cutaneous neurofibromas, a plexiform neck neurofibroma, and axillary and inguinal freckling.

The PTPN11 mutation was predicted to destabilize the inactive form of PTPN11, resulting in increased basal activity and a gain of function. The girl also developed bilateral optic gliomas before age 2 years, which may be explained by an additive effect of both the NF1 and PTPN11 mutations on the Ras pathway.
