<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al.

Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

It regulates gene expression and stimulates mitogenesis and appears to mediate insulin/IGF1-stimulated glucose transport. Thus, the finding that the homozygous Irs1 knockout mouse survives with only mild resistance to hypertension was surprising. This dilemma was provisionally resolved by the discovery by Sun et al. (1995) of a second IRS signaling protein in mouse. They purified and cloned a likely candidate from mouse myeloid progenitor cells and, because of its resemblance to IRS1, they designated it IRS2. Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

Ogihara et al. (1997) screened a human genomic library with a mouse Irs2 cDNA. They isolated a cDNA encoding a full-length human IRS2 protein. Using immunoprecipitation studies, Ogihara et al.

They then isolated a cDNA using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptide fragments of the purified protein.

Using the conserved zinc finger DNA-binding domain of GATA1 in the yeast 2-hybrid system, Tsang et al. (1997) identified a novel multitype zinc finger protein in mouse, which they designated Fog (friend of GATA1), that binds GATA1 but not a functionally inactive GATA1 mutant lacking the amino (N) finger. They found that Fog is coexpressed with GATA1 during embryonic development and in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. Furthermore, Fog and GATA1 synergistically activated transcription from a hematopoietic-specific regulatory region and cooperated during both erythroid and megakaryocytic cell differentiation. These findings indicated that Fog acts as a cofactor for GATA1 and provided a paradigm for the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression by GATA transcription factors.

By database searching with the mouse Fog1 sequence as query, Freson et al. (2003) identified homologous human sequences.

The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig. The gene produces a 4.7-kb transcript that encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein consisting of 928 amino acids.";dryja cloned dna fragments chromosome three identified rflps region q q contains retinoblastoma entry locus friend isolated cdna detects chromosomal segment properties gene retinoblastoma locus gene found expressed many tumor types rna transcript found retinoblastomas osteosarcomas locus spanned least kb dna friend started kb dna sequence could detect deletions involving q retinoblastomas used chromosome walking techniques isolate map kb surrounding genomic dna one single copy fragments recognized dna sequence mouse genome also human chromosome conservation dna sequence mouse humans suggested cloned fragment contained coding exon gene therefore tested ability fragment hybridize rna derived retinoblastoma cells human retinal cells found indeed recognized kb rna transcript retinal cell line transcript detectable retinoblastomas outlined cavenee cdna described friend used probe screen rna samples different tumor types shown hybridize tested except retinoblastomas retinoblastoma associated osteosarcomas furthermore use cdna analyze genomic structure homologous locus retinoblastomas associated osteosarcomas showed somatically altered genomic loci alterations took form fragments altered mobility suggesting gene rearrangements underrepresented fragments suggesting heterozygous deletions missing fragments suggesting homozygous deletions since one homozygous deletions entirely contained within genomic locus homologous cdna probe suggested expressed gene indeed rb gene dryja isolated cdna fragment derived human retinal mrna detected locus within q often deleted retinoblastoma lee prepared rabbit antiserum rb protein studied horsthemke showed present cell lines expressing normal rb mrna detected retinoblastoma cell lines rb protein metabolically labeled p phosphoric acid indicating phosphoprotein biochemical fractionation immunofluorescence studies demonstrated protein located nucleus furthermore protein retained could eluted dna cellulose columns suggesting dna binding activity gene encoding messenger rna kb located proximity esterase entry identified lee retinoblastoma susceptibility gene basis chromosomal location homozygous deletion tumor specific alterations expression transcription gene abnormal retinoblastomas examined mrna detectable whereas others expressed variable quantities mrna decreased molecular size kb contrast full length rb mrna present human fetal retina placenta tumors neuroblastoma medulloblastoma sequence cdna clones indicated hypothetical protein amino acids whyte demonstrated da cellular protein one cellular targets implicated process transformation adenovirus e proteins fact product rb gene interaction formation stable protein protein complex first demonstration physical link oncogene antioncogene similar case made numerous disorders many common toguchida reported complete genomic sequence rb gene contained bp contig gene produces kb transcript encodes nuclear phosphoprotein consisting amino acids;0

The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency.

GATA1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/305371"">305371</a>) is essential for normal primitive and definitive erythropoiesis and is expressed at high levels in erythroid cells, mast cells, and megakaryocytes. GATA2 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors, including early erythroid cells, mast cells, and megakaryocytes, and also in nonhematopoietic embryonic stem cells. In chicken erythroid progenitors, forced expression of GATA2 promotes proliferation at the expense of differentiation (Briegel et al., 1993). GATA3 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/131320"">131320</a>) expression is restricted to T-lymphoid cells and some nonhematopoietic cell types, including embryonic stem cells.";gata family transcription factors contain zinc fingers dna binding domain emerged candidate regulators gene expression hematopoietic cells tsai gata entry essential normal primitive definitive erythropoiesis expressed high levels erythroid cells mast cells megakaryocytes gata expressed hematopoietic progenitors including early erythroid cells mast cells megakaryocytes also nonhematopoietic embryonic stem cells chicken erythroid progenitors forced expression gata promotes proliferation expense differentiation briegel gata entry expression restricted lymphoid cells nonhematopoietic cell types including embryonic stem cells;2
