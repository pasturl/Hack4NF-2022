Coussens et al. (1985) identified a potential cell surface receptor of the tyrosine kinase gene family and characterized it by cloning the gene. Its primary sequence is very similar to that of the human epidermal growth factor receptor. Because of the seemingly close relationship to the human EGF receptor, the authors called the gene HER2.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

ATRX_DEL;0.0071579184577571;ATRX;"ATRX CHROMATIN REMODELER; ATRX";live;"Stayton et al. (1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 as bait, Hu et al. (1994) isolated B-cell cDNAs encoding a protein that they called CD40-binding protein (CD40bp). The predicted CD40bp protein contains a RING finger DNA-binding motif, a cys/his-rich region, and a coiled-coil domain.

(1994) suggested that CD40bp, along with TRAF1 and TRAF2, comprise a family of proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic faces of the TNFR family and have in common a TRAF domain.

Independently, Sato et al. (1995) and Cheng et al. (1995) identified CD40bp, designating it CAP1 (CD40-associated protein-1) and CRAF1 (CD40 receptor-associated factor 1), respectively. Sato et al. (1995) demonstrated that CAP1 binds specifically to the cytoplasmic domain of CD40, but not to that of TNFR1, TNFR2, or FAS. The C-terminal TRAF domain of CAP1 was sufficient to mediate binding to CD40 and homodimerization. Cheng et al. (1995) isolated mouse and human CRAF1 cDNAs. The predicted 568-amino acid human protein is 96% identical to mouse CRAF1. These authors divided the TRAF domain into 2 regions: TRAF-N, the more N-terminal coiled-coil subdomain, and TRAF-C, which was necessary and sufficient for CRAF1 to interact with CD40.

(1995) used mosaic flies to screen for tumor suppressors or negative regulators of cell proliferation. The cellular composition of these flies resembled that of cancer patients who are chimeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic cells. One of the genes they identified was the 'large tumor suppressor' gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive proliferation and form large tumors in many tissues in mosaic adults. Mutants homozygous for various lats alleles display a range of developmental defects, including embryonic lethality. Although many tumor suppressors were identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it was not clear whether these fly genes were directly relevant to tumorigenesis in mammals.

Tao et al. (1999) isolated mammalian homologs of Drosophila lats. Human LATS1 and mouse Lats1 share 99% amino acid sequence identity in the C-terminal kinase domain; human LATS1 and fly lats share 74% amino acid sequence identity in this region. Northern blot analysis detected LATS1 expression in all fetal and adult tissues examined, with highest expression in adult ovary.

Staining intensity was related to stage of maturation, with faint staining of spermatogonia, increased staining in primary spermatocytes to spermatids, and reduced staining in tubules with mature spermatozoa. FANCM expression was also present in the interstitial Leydig cells.

Fouquet et al. (2017) performed qRT-PCR in germ cells from human fetal ovaries and observed expression throughout ovarian development, with highest expression in ovaries at stages containing the highest proportion of germ cells progressing into meiotic prophase I. Cell-sorting experiments revealed that FANCM transcripts were predominant in oogonial cells compared to somatic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human fetal ovaries showed that FANCM protein was present in the nuclei of oogonia, with strongest staining in pachytene stage oocytes. In addition, staining localized along the chromosomes in pachytene cells undergoing meiotic recombination. FANCM was also observed in oocytes arrested at the diplotene stage of prophase I during the last trimester of pregnancy and in adults.

Watanabe-Fukunaga et al. (1992) isolated mouse Fas antigen from a murine macrophage cDNA library. The deduced 306-amino acid sequence shares 49.3% sequence identity with the human sequence. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb Fas antigen mRNA in mouse thymus, heart, liver, and ovary.

Oehm et al. (1992) demonstrated that the 48-kD APO1 antigen, defined by the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-APO1, is the same as the FAS antigen. APO1 was expressed on the cell surface of various normal and malignant cells, including activated human T and B lymphocytes and a variety of malignant human lymphoid cell lines, and binding of anti-APO1 antibody to the APO1 antigen induced apoptosis.

This sequence, which they called PKS (presumably for 'protein kinase sequence'), showed 71% nucleotide homology to RAF1. The predicted amino acid sequence of the kinase domain was sufficiently like the sequence of v-raf to suggest that PKS may encode a polypeptide with serine/threonine kinase activity. Mark et al.

By screening a mouse cDNA library with a v-raf oncogene probe, Huebner et al. (1986) also isolated a transforming raf-related cDNA, A-raf, that represented a gene distinct from RAF1.

Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF.

The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

Imbalances in glutamatergic function have been implicated in neuronal death following ischemia, in hypoglycemia or anoxia, in epilepsy, and in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate actions are mediated by glutamate receptors which fall into 2 distinct classes: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels whose responses to selective agonists define the N-methyl-D-aspartate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxasole-4-propionate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138248"">138248</a>), and kainate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138245"">138245</a>) subtypes.

Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>).

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al.

Homologs of this gene have been identified in several species, including mouse and human. Pittman et al. (1998) reported the identification of a novel member of the RAD51 gene family in both mouse and human. The mouse cDNA, Rad51d, isolated by screening EST databases with yeast RAD55 and human RAD51B amino acid sequences, encodes a predicted 329-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 35,260 Da. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of multiple transcripts of the Rad51d gene in all tissues examined. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from 7 mammalian species demonstrated that the RAD51D gene is conserved. Pittman et al. (1998) used the mouse nucleotide sequence to screen a human EST database and identified 2 RAD51D cDNA clones from human T-lymphocyte and placenta libraries; both cDNAs appeared to be variants of the mouse gene. The shorter cDNA represented an alternatively spliced product and excluded sequences corresponding to 2 exons in the mouse gene, one of which encodes the first ATP-binding motif. The longer cDNA skipped a single exon present in the mouse gene, resulting in a frameshift and a predicted truncated protein. The authors stated that if the frameshift is ignored, the full-length putative 289-amino acid protein shares 71% sequence identity with the predicted mouse protein, and the mouse and human RAD51D genes have 2 conserved ATP-binding domains similar to other RecA-related genes.

Cartwright et al. (1998) also isolated human and mouse RAD51L3, or R51H3, cDNAs. They found that the sequence of the predicted 328-amino acid human protein is 82% identical to that of mouse RAD51L3. Northern blot analysis revealed that human RAD51L3 is expressed as a 1.7-kb mRNA in all tissues, with the highest levels in testis.

Kawabata and Saeki (1999) cloned RAD51L3, which they called TRAD, from a placenta cDNA library based on sequence similarity with the mouse gene.

Kim et al. (2002) reported that MTOR forms a stoichiometric complex with RAPTOR, an evolutionarily conserved protein with at least 2 roles in the MTOR pathway. They cloned the full-length cDNA for RAPTOR, which contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with 1,335 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 149 kD. A previously identified partial cDNA, KIAA1303 (Nagase et al., 2000), is contained within the RAPTOR cDNA. All RAPTOR homologs have a novel N-terminal domain the authors called RNC (RAPTOR N-terminal conserved) that consists of 3 blocks with at least 67 to 79% sequence similarity and is predicted to have a high propensity to form alpha helices. Following the RNC domain, all RAPTOR homologs have 3 HEAT repeats, which are followed by 7 WD40 repeats in the C-terminal third of the protein. Northern blot analysis showed that RAPTOR is expressed in all tissues in a pattern similar to that of MTOR, with the highest levels of both mRNAs in skeletal muscle, brain, kidney, and placenta.

Independently, Hara et al. (2002) also cloned the RAPTOR gene. They found that RAPTOR is a 150-kD MTOR-binding protein that also binds eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/602223"">602223</a>) and p70 S6 kinase-alpha (S6K1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608938"">608938</a>).

The SET domain is a highly conserved, approximately 150-amino acid motif implicated in the modulation of chromatin structure. It was originally identified as part of a larger conserved region present in the Drosophila Trithorax protein and was subsequently identified in the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and 'Enhancer of zeste' proteins, from which the acronym SET is derived. Studies have suggested that the SET domain may be a signature of proteins that modulate transcriptionally active or repressed chromatin states through chromatin remodeling activities. In the course of searching sequence databases for proteins containing SET domains, Harte et al. (1999) identified the SETDB1 sequence. They determined that SETDB1 has a C-terminal SET domain that is well-conserved except that it contains a 347-amino acid insertion between its most highly conserved regions.

A number of sodium-dependent phosphate transporters have been identified.

Type 1 transporters, such as NPT1 (SLC17A1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/182308"">182308</a>), are found mainly in kidney and do not appear to be regulated by dietary phosphate levels. Type 2 transporters can be subdivided into 2 groups based on sequence similarity and tissue distribution.

The PML gene is involved in the t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/612376"">612376</a>), which generates the oncogenic fusion protein PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180240"">180240</a>). PML-NBs are disrupted in APL and are thus implicated in APL pathogenesis (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007; Salomoni et al., 2008).";pml tumor suppressor protein essential formation dynamic macromolecular nuclear structure called pml nuclear body pml nb pml nbs also referred nuclear domains kremer bodies pml oncogenic domains unlike specialized subnuclear structures pml nbs involved diverse cellular functions including sequestration release proteins mediation posttranslational modifications promotion nuclear events response various cellular stresses pml gene involved translocation acute promyelocytic leukemia apl entry generates oncogenic fusion protein pml retinoic acid receptor alpha rara entry pml nbs disrupted apl thus implicated apl pathogenesis bernardi pandolfi salomoni;26

Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

By direct selection of cDNAs from the 5q23-q31 chromosomal interval, Dolganov et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding a human Rad50 homolog. The human RAD50 gene spans 100 to 130 kb. Northern blot analysis revealed that the RAD50 gene was expressed as a 5.5-kb mRNA predominantly in testis. A faint 7-kb transcript, which the authors considered to be an mRNA with an alternatively processed 3-prime end, was also detected. Yeast Rad50 and the predicted 1,312-amino acid human RAD50 protein share more than 50% identity in their N- and C-termini. The central heptad repeat domains of the proteins have relatively divergent primary sequences but are predicted to adopt very similar coiled-coil structures. Using immunoprecipitation, Dolganov et al. (1996) demonstrated that the 153-kD RAD50 is stably associated with MRE11 in a protein complex, which may also include proteins of 95 kD, 200 kD, and 350 kD.";cerevisiae rad gene encodes protein essential double stranded dna break repair nonhomologous dna end joining chromosomal integration yeast rad mre entry xrs proteins appear act multiprotein complex consistent observation mutations genes confer nearly identical phenotypes meiotic recombination elevated rates homologous mitotic recombination direct selection cdnas q q chromosomal interval dolganov isolated cdna encoding human rad homolog human rad gene spans kb northern blot analysis revealed rad gene expressed kb mrna predominantly testis faint kb transcript authors considered mrna alternatively processed prime end also detected yeast rad predicted amino acid human rad protein share identity n c termini central heptad repeat domains proteins relatively divergent primary sequences predicted adopt similar coiled coil structures using immunoprecipitation dolganov demonstrated kd rad stably associated mre protein complex may also include proteins kd kd kd;1
