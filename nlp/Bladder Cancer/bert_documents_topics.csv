Coussens et al. (1985) identified a potential cell surface receptor of the tyrosine kinase gene family and characterized it by cloning the gene. Its primary sequence is very similar to that of the human epidermal growth factor receptor. Because of the seemingly close relationship to the human EGF receptor, the authors called the gene HER2.

RB1_SNP;0.0632120042443335;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

(1995) identified the BRCA2 gene by positional cloning of a region on chromosome 13q12-q13 implicated in Icelandic families with breast cancer (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/612555"">612555</a>). The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance.

An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

(1984) derived a DNA clone that was specific for the t(14;18) translocation. The probe detected rearrangement of the homologous DNA segment in leukemic cells and in follicular lymphoma cells with the t(14;18) chromosome translocation but not in other neoplastic or normal B or T cells. Tsujimoto et al. (1984) concluded that the probe identified the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18q21 that was unrelated to known oncogenes and may be important in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms with this translocation.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

Tsujimoto et al. (1985) found that their most specific probe hybridized to cellular DNA from hamster and mouse under stringent conditions, indicating that at least part of the BCL2 gene is conserved across mammalian species as are many cellular oncogenes. Negrini et al. (1987) cloned the murine gene homologous to BCL2 in man.

<Subhead> BRAG1: A Spurious 'BCL2-related' Gene

Das et al. (1996) reported the isolation and molecular characterization of a novel Bcl2-related cDNA from a human glioma. They designated the gene BRAG1 for 'brain related apoptosis gene.' They gene showed extensive homology to the BCL2 family of genes. The gene was expressed in normal brain as a 4.5-kb transcript and as a 1.8-kb transcript in human gliomas, which suggested to the authors that it may be rearranged in these tumors. The open reading frame of the BRAG1 gene encoded a protein of 31 kD. Using a bacterial expression vector, Das et al. (1996) produced BRAG1 protein that was found to crossreact with a BCL2 monoclonal antibody, further suggesting structural and immunologic similarity to BCL2.

ATRX_DEL;0.0052642427600841;ATRX;"ATRX CHROMATIN REMODELER; ATRX";live;"Stayton et al. (1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Ullrich and Schlessinger (1990) distinguished 4 classes. One class is represented by the ERBB family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164870"">164870</a>). A second class includes dimeric receptors such as the insulin receptor as well as several protooncogenes such as MET (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>) and ROS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165020"">165020</a>). A third class is characterized by the presence of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and by the interruption of the catalytic domain in 2 parts by a specific hydrophilic 'interkinase' sequence of variable length. This class includes the protooncogene FMS, which encodes the CSF1 receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), which corresponds to the 'white spotting' locus in the mouse, as well as 2 PDGF receptor genes (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>) and FLT1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165070"">165070</a>).

Northern blot analysis detected 2.7- and 1.9-kb FAS mRNAs in thymus, liver, ovary, and heart. Functional expression studies in mouse cells showed that the FAS antigen induced antibody-triggered apoptosis.

Watanabe-Fukunaga et al. (1992) isolated mouse Fas antigen from a murine macrophage cDNA library. The deduced 306-amino acid sequence shares 49.3% sequence identity with the human sequence. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb Fas antigen mRNA in mouse thymus, heart, liver, and ovary.

Oehm et al. (1992) demonstrated that the 48-kD APO1 antigen, defined by the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-APO1, is the same as the FAS antigen. APO1 was expressed on the cell surface of various normal and malignant cells, including activated human T and B lymphocytes and a variety of malignant human lymphoid cell lines, and binding of anti-APO1 antibody to the APO1 antigen induced apoptosis.

<Subhead> Antisense Transcript SAF

Yan et al. (2005) described a novel RNA transcribed from the opposite strand of intron 1 of the human FAS gene, which they named SAF. The 1.5-kb transcript was expressed in human heart, placenta, liver, muscle, and pancreas, as well as in several cancer cell lines. SAF-transfected Jurkat cells were highly resistant to FAS-mediated but not to TNF-alpha (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/191160"">191160</a>)-mediated apoptosis, compared to control transfectants. Although the overall mRNA expression level of FAS was not affected, expression of some novel forms of FAS transcripts was increased in SAF-transfected cells. Yan et al. (2005) hypothesized that SAF may protect T lymphocytes from FAS-mediated apoptosis by blocking the binding of FASL or its agonistic FAS antibody, and that SAF may regulate expression of FAS alternative splice forms through pre-mRNA processing.";itoh isolated cdnas encoding human fas antigen human cell lymphoma cdna library sequence analysis predicted amino acid signal sequence followed mature protein amino acids single transmembrane domain molecular mass approximately kd fas antigen shows structural homology number cell surface receptors including tumor necrosis factor tnf receptors entry entry low affinity nerve growth factor receptor ngfr entry northern blot analysis detected kb fas mrnas thymus liver ovary heart functional expression studies mouse cells showed fas antigen induced antibody triggered apoptosis watanabe fukunaga isolated mouse fas antigen murine macrophage cdna library deduced amino acid sequence shares sequence identity human sequence northern blot analysis detected kb fas antigen mrna mouse thymus heart liver ovary oehm demonstrated kd apo antigen defined mouse monoclonal antibody anti apo fas antigen apo expressed cell surface various normal malignant cells including activated human b lymphocytes variety malignant human lymphoid cell lines binding anti apo antibody apo antigen induced apoptosis subhead antisense transcript saf yan described novel rna transcribed opposite strand intron human fas gene named saf kb transcript expressed human heart placenta liver muscle pancreas well several cancer cell lines saf transfected jurkat cells highly resistant fas mediated tnf alpha entry mediated apoptosis compared control transfectants although overall mrna expression level fas affected expression novel forms fas transcripts increased saf transfected cells yan hypothesized saf may protect lymphocytes fas mediated apoptosis blocking binding fasl agonistic fas antibody saf may regulate expression fas alternative splice forms pre mrna processing;10

(1994) isolated a cDNA encoding SETDB1, which they called KIAA0067. The deduced SETDB1 protein has 1,291 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected SETDB1 expression in all 16 human tissues examined.

The SET domain is a highly conserved, approximately 150-amino acid motif implicated in the modulation of chromatin structure. It was originally identified as part of a larger conserved region present in the Drosophila Trithorax protein and was subsequently identified in the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and 'Enhancer of zeste' proteins, from which the acronym SET is derived. Studies have suggested that the SET domain may be a signature of proteins that modulate transcriptionally active or repressed chromatin states through chromatin remodeling activities. In the course of searching sequence databases for proteins containing SET domains, Harte et al. (1999) identified the SETDB1 sequence. They determined that SETDB1 has a C-terminal SET domain that is well-conserved except that it contains a 347-amino acid insertion between its most highly conserved regions. The authors found that the C. elegans YNCA gene product is highly similar to SETDB1 and also contains a bifurcated SET domain.

HGF_SNP;0.0018067914625736;HGF;"HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR; HGF";live;"Plasma from patients with fulminant hepatic failure contains a factor that stimulates the growth of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

It also has a C-terminal endonuclease domain homologous to that of ERCC4, but sequence degeneracy suggests that it is inactive.

By immunohistochemical analysis of human testicular tissue sections, Kasak et al. (2018) observed localization of FANCM to the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules. Staining intensity was related to stage of maturation, with faint staining of spermatogonia, increased staining in primary spermatocytes to spermatids, and reduced staining in tubules with mature spermatozoa. FANCM expression was also present in the interstitial Leydig cells.

Fouquet et al.

Cell-sorting experiments revealed that FANCM transcripts were predominant in oogonial cells compared to somatic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human fetal ovaries showed that FANCM protein was present in the nuclei of oogonia, with strongest staining in pachytene stage oocytes.

Herzog et al. (1993) cloned, sequenced, and mapped the human homolog of a proposed bovine NPY Y3 receptor reported by Rimland et al. (1991). The human cDNA clone was derived from a human lung cDNA library. The 1,670-bp sequence predicts a single open reading frame (ORF) of 352 amino acids, with 92% amino acid identity to the reported bovine sequence. The amino acid sequence shares features common to many other G protein-coupled receptors, including the 7-transmembrane regions and putative glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The receptor shows 36% identity to the interleukin-8 receptor (IL8RA; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146929"">146929</a>), which is located on chromosome 2, and to the angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/106165"">106165</a>), but only 21% identity to the NPY Y1 receptor.

The recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues involves interleukin-8 (IL8; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146930"">146930</a>) and several related chemotactic cytokines that attract and activate leukocytes. Loetscher et al. (1994) noted that these proteins are similar in size, have marked sequence similarities, and are characterized by 4 conserved cysteines that form 2 essential disulfide bonds. Two subfamilies are distinguished according to the arrangement of the first 2 cysteines, which are either adjacent (CC subfamily) or separated by one amino acid (CXC subfamily). The CXC cytokines activate primarily neutrophil leukocytes, while CC cytokines act on monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. These chemotactic agonists act via 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors, e.g., the 2 interleukin-8 receptors, IL8RA and IL8RB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146928"">146928</a>). Chemotactic cytokines of the CC subfamily do not bind to IL8 receptors. Loetscher et al. (1994) isolated from a human blood monocyte cDNA library a cDNA clone encoding a protein of 352 amino acids, corresponding to a receptor of the 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled type. They referred to the gene and the deduced protein as LESTR for 'leukocyte-derived seven-transmembrane domain receptor.' It shows 92.6% identity with a bovine neuropeptide Y receptor. In the monocyte library, LESTR cDNA fragments were about 20 times as frequent as cDNA coding for IL8RA and IL8RB, and much higher levels of mRNA specific for LESTR than for IL8R were found in human blood neutrophils and lymphocytes. Although the ligand for LESTR could not be identified among a large number of chemotactic cytokines, the high expression in white blood cells and the marked sequence relation to IL8RA and IL8RB suggested to Loetscher et al. (1994) that LESTR may function in the activation of inflammatory cells.

The human CD4 molecule (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186940"">186940</a>) acts as the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but CD4 supports viral entry into cells only when it is expressed on specific human cell types (Clapham et al., 1991). Weiner et al. (1991) and Dragic and Alizon (1993) presented evidence that the restriction of HIV-1 infection to certain human cell types is the result of a specific cofactor, encoded in the human genome, which is required for cell virus membrane fusion. Feng et al. (1996) undertook the isolation and characterization of the putative human HIV-1 fusion cofactor using an approach that made no assumptions about the mode of action of the cofactor other than that the cofactor would allow a CD4-expressing nonhuman cell to undergo viral fusion. They transfected CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells with a HeLa cell cDNA library and then incubated the transfected cells with an NIH 3T3 cell line expressing the HIV-1 Env gene (which is required by HIV-1 for fusion); transfected CD4+ cells that fused with Env-expressing cells could be distinguished by utilizing a lacZ biochemical marker specific to such fusion products. Feng et al. (1996) isolated a 1.7-kb human cDNA clone that allowed the CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells to undergo fusion. The cDNA contained a 352-codon ORF whose predicted amino acid sequence has 7 predicted transmembrane segments and resembles that of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The predicted molecular weight of the protein is 39,745 Da and its primary sequence includes 2 potential N-linked glycosylation sites.

The close spatial relationship was conserved in all species from which the NRAS gene had been isolated. The UNR cDNA contained an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 798 amino acids. UNR transcripts were detected in mouse, rat, and human cells. Only a single copy of UNR was detected in the mouse.

RUNX1 has a primary role in the development of all hematopoietic cell types; is required for CD8 T-cell development during thymopoiesis; determines the nociceptive sensory neuron phenotype; plays a supportive role in bone formation; and can produce oncogenic transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601626"">601626</a>) (review by Cohen, 2009).

Phylogenetically conserved restriction fragments in the vicinity of the breakpoints on chromosomes 22 and 11 allowed identification of transcribed sequences from these regions and indicated that a hybrid transcript might be generated by the translocation (Zucman et al., 1992). Delattre et al. (1992) screened cDNA libraries with these conserved fragments and found that the translocation alters the open reading frame of an expressed gene, EWS, on chromosome 22 by substituting a sequence encoding a putative RNA-binding domain for that of the DNA-binding domain of the FLI1 gene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/193067"">193067</a>). The EWS protein encodes 656 amino acids. The N terminus contains a repeated degenerated polypeptide of 7 to 12 residues rich in tyrosine, serine, threonine, glycine, and glutamine, and the C terminus contains 3 arginine- and glycine-rich tracts and a putative RNA-binding domain. Plougastel et al. (1994) found that the human and mouse proteins share 98% sequence homology.
