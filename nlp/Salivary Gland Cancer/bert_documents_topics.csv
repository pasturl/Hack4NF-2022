RB1_SNP;0.0334308222463691;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development. Northern analysis revealed that GLI is expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells but not in most adult tissue. A fragile site of the folic acid type has been described at 12q13. In addition, translocations involving this region of chromosome 12 have been described in myxoid liposarcoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151900"">151900</a>) and salivary gland tumors.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Identity to all previously known oncogenes except ERBB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/131550"">131550</a>) was ruled out by the fact that they are encoded by other chromosomes; identity to ERBB is probably excluded by failure of direct hybridizations of the 2 probes. MET was the designation suggested by Cooper et al. (1984).

Dean et al. (1985) showed that MET is in the tyrosine kinase family of oncogenes. It appeared to be most closely related in sequence to the human insulin receptor and ABL oncogene.

From the sequence of MET cDNA, Park et al. (1987) concluded that this oncogene is a cell-surface receptor for a then unknown ligand. The c-Met protooncogene product is a receptor-like tyrosine kinase composed of disulfide-linked subunits of 50 kD (alpha) and 145 kD (beta). In the fully processed c-Met product, the alpha subunit is extracellular, and the beta subunit has extracellular, transmembrane, and tyrosine kinase domains as well as sites of tyrosine phosphorylation.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance.

CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

It regulates gene expression and stimulates mitogenesis and appears to mediate insulin/IGF1-stimulated glucose transport. Thus, the finding that the homozygous Irs1 knockout mouse survives with only mild resistance to hypertension was surprising. This dilemma was provisionally resolved by the discovery by Sun et al. (1995) of a second IRS signaling protein in mouse. They purified and cloned a likely candidate from mouse myeloid progenitor cells and, because of its resemblance to IRS1, they designated it IRS2. Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

HGF_SNP;0.0017204399769129;HGF;"HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR; HGF";live;"Plasma from patients with fulminant hepatic failure contains a factor that stimulates the growth of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

This sequence, which they called PKS (presumably for 'protein kinase sequence'), showed 71% nucleotide homology to RAF1. The predicted amino acid sequence of the kinase domain was sufficiently like the sequence of v-raf to suggest that PKS may encode a polypeptide with serine/threonine kinase activity. Mark et al. (1986) found that expression of PKS mRNA (2.7 kb) was elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 2 patients with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia, a disease in which autoantibodies are produced following the lymphoproliferative activation of B cells.

When stably transfected into an IL3-dependent cell line, it inhibited cell death upon growth factor withdrawal at least as well as BCL2. Unexpectedly, the smaller mRNA species (BCLXS) encodes a protein that inhibits the ability of BCL2 to enhance the survival of growth factor-deprived cells.

The translocation involves the TCR-delta locus (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186810"">186810</a>) on 14q11 and also a transcribed sequence on 11p15. They found that the gene on 11p15 is normally expressed in rhombomeres of the developing hindbrain. The gene product, designated rhombosine or rhombotin, has 155 amino acids and no homology to any previously described protein.

Because human and mouse rhombotin are virtually identical in derived protein sequence, rendering it difficult to identify functionally important regions or motifs, Boehm et al. (1990) isolated and compared rhombotin sequences from disparate species. They showed a sequence that is highly homologous to that of human and mouse rhombotin in Drosophila DNA. This comparison and others suggested that rhombotin, which lacks a DNA-binding homeodomain, may belong to a new class of transcriptional regulators that modulate transcription via intermolecular competitive binding to certain DNA-binding transcription factors. The structure of the predicted rhombotin protein suggests that it consists of 2 tandemly arranged cysteine-rich regions, which were subsequently identified in 3 transcription factors appended to putative DNA binding and activation domains, wherein they were termed LIM domains. The function of LIM domains may be in protein-protein interaction. LIM domains show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Consistent with its close structural homology to the human gene, the mouse homolog Ttg1 maps to chromosome 7, distal to the beta-globin locus (Angel et al., 1993).

Boehm et al. (1991) isolated 2 homologs of the rhombotin gene. Rhombotin-2 (RBTN2; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180385"">180385</a>) is located close to the T-ALL breakpoint cluster region on 11p13.

Rhom-2 in the mouse is similar to the human homolog. Boehm et al. (1991) identified a third rhombotin-like gene (RBTN3; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180386"">180386</a>) and determined that it is not situated on chromosome 11.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

The deduced 764-amino acid protein has a molecular mass of 86.8 kD and contains a signal peptide, 7 transmembrane regions, 5 potential glycosylation sites, and a short intracytoplasmic region. The TSHR cDNA encoded a functional receptor that activated adenylate cyclase in response to TSH.

Libert et al. (1989) used a dog Tshr cDNA to isolate a human TSHR cDNA from a thyroid cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced 744-amino acid protein with 90.3% homology to the dog protein. Two major 4.6- and 4.4-kb mRNA transcripts were identified, suggesting alternative splicing.

By analyzing several TSHR cDNA clones, Misrahi et al. (1990) determined that the mature TSHR polypeptide contains 743 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 84.5 kD. The putative TSH receptor has a 394-residue extracellular domain, a 266-residue transmembrane domain, and an 83-residue intracellular domain.

A number of sodium-dependent phosphate transporters have been identified. Although functionally related, these phosphate transporters are structurally distinct and can be broadly grouped into 3 subtypes based on sequence identity. Type 1 transporters, such as NPT1 (SLC17A1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/182308"">182308</a>), are found mainly in kidney and do not appear to be regulated by dietary phosphate levels. Type 2 transporters can be subdivided into 2 groups based on sequence similarity and tissue distribution. One group, which includes NaPi3 (SLC34A1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/182309"">182309</a>), consists of transporters that are found almost exclusively in the renal proximal tubule, whereas the second group consists of transporters that are more widely distributed. Type 3 transporters can also function as membrane receptors for primate retroviruses. By searching an EST database for cDNAs that show sequence similarity to NaPi3, Feild et al. (1999) identified a human small intestine cDNA encoding the novel phosphate transporter SLC34A2, which they named NaPi3B. They isolated a full-length SLC34A2 cDNA from both human small intestine and lung cDNAs. The deduced 690-amino acid SLC34A2 protein is a type 2 phosphate transporter. It contains 8 predicted transmembrane domains and a cysteine-rich N-terminal region. SLC34A2 shares 78% amino acid identity with the mouse sodium-dependent phosphate transporter IIb. Functional studies showed that SLC34A2 is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter that is strongly sensitive to pH, with phosphate uptake increased at more acidic pH. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb SLC34A2 transcript in several human tissues of epithelial origin; kidney also contained high levels of a 2.4-kb transcript. SLC34A2 was most abundantly expressed in lung, with moderate expression in kidney, pancreas, and prostate.";inorganic phosphate absorption small intestine reabsorption renal tubule play key roles control inorganic phosphate metabolism maintenance phosphate homeostasis number sodium dependent phosphate transporters identified although functionally related phosphate transporters structurally distinct broadly grouped subtypes based sequence identity type transporters npt slc entry found mainly kidney appear regulated dietary phosphate levels type transporters subdivided groups based sequence similarity tissue distribution one group includes napi slc entry consists transporters found almost exclusively renal proximal tubule whereas second group consists transporters widely distributed type transporters also function membrane receptors primate retroviruses searching est database cdnas show sequence similarity napi feild identified human small intestine cdna encoding novel phosphate transporter slc named napi b isolated full length slc cdna human small intestine lung cdnas deduced amino acid slc protein type phosphate transporter contains predicted transmembrane domains cysteine rich n terminal region slc shares amino acid identity mouse sodium dependent phosphate transporter iib functional studies showed slc sodium dependent phosphate transporter strongly sensitive ph phosphate uptake increased acidic ph northern blot analysis detected kb slc transcript several human tissues epithelial origin kidney also contained high levels kb transcript slc abundantly expressed lung moderate expression kidney pancreas prostate;0
