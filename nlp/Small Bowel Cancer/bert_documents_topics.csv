They isolated 7 cDNA clones that corresponded to 7 new non-class I structural genes. Since these genes were located within the hemochromatosis (HFE1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/235200"">235200</a>) candidate gene region, they referred to the genes as HCG (hemochromatosis candidate gene) I-VII. El Kahloun et al. (1993) concluded that HCG I, III, V, and VI are probably single-copy genes situated 180, 155, 140, and 230 kb, respectively, centromeric to HLA-A. There were several copies of the other 3 genes. Each of the genes was associated with a CpG/HTF island.

Using cDNA hybridization selection with a 320-kb YAC containing the HLA-A gene to screen a human duodenal cDNA library, Goei et al. (1994) isolated and characterized 10 novel gene fragments. Also in search of the HFE gene, Yaouanq et al. (1994) identified a zone of linkage disequilibrium which suggested that the HFE gene may reside within a 400-kb expanse of DNA between the locus they referred to as i97 and HLA-F (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/143110"">143110</a>). Totaro et al. (1996) generated a detailed 1.2-Mb physical and transcription map of 6p spanning the HLA class I region from HLA-E to approximately 500 kb telomeric of HLA-F. The localization of known genes was refined, and a new gene from the RNA helicase superfamily was identified. Overall, 14 transcription units in addition to the HLA genes were detected and integrated into the map. Thirteen cDNA fragments showed no similarity with known sequences, and could be candidates for hemochromatosis.

By linkage disequilibrium and full haplotype analysis of hereditary hemochromatosis patients, Feder et al. (1996) identified a 250-kb region more than 3 Mb telomeric of the MHC on chromosome 6 that is identical by descent in 85% of patient chromosomes. Within this region, they identified a gene, which they termed HLA-H, that encodes a predicted 343-amino acid protein related to the MHC class I gene family. The protein comprises a signal sequence, peptide-binding regions (alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains), a transmembrane region, and a small cytoplasmic portion. One of the most conserved structural features of MHC class I molecules in HLA-H are the 4 cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges in the alpha-2 and alpha-3 domains. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb major mRNA transcript in all tissues tested, except brain.

Searching for new human MHC class I related genes, Hashimoto et al. (1995) identified MHC-related protein-1 (MR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600764"">600764</a>) and a second gene, MR2. The HLA-H gene (HFE) reported by Feder et al. (1996) as a candidate gene for hereditary hemochromatosis turned out to be identical to the MR2 gene of Hashimoto et al. (1995). Hashimoto et al. (1997) isolated the murine homolog of this gene. It was found to be similar to its human counterpart with an overall predicted amino acid sequence similarity of approximately 66% and expression in various tissues as in human. An extra 8 amino acid residues between the alpha-1 and the alpha-2 domains in the mouse molecule compared to the human counterpart could be explained by the creation of the additional coding sequence from the intron.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance.

Using potassium permanganate to probe DNA conformation in vivo, Duncan et al.

The predicted 467-amino acid polypeptide, which the authors called JV18-1, shows maximal homology to Mad genes at the amino and carboxy termini of the protein, with 62% identity to Mad over 373 amino acids. Drosophila Mad apparently acts downstream of the TGF-beta receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/190181"">190181</a>) to transduce signals from the members of the TGF-beta gene family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/190180"">190180</a>).

Graff et al. (1996) described a family of Xenopus proteins homologous to the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans CEM genes. MAD and MAD-related proteins are important components of the serine/threonine kinase receptor signal transduction pathways. Eppert et al.

MADR2 shares high homology with MADR1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601595"">601595</a>) and significant homology with DPC4. They reported that MADR2 is rapidly phosphorylated by activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.

By RT-PCR of human erythroleukemia cell mRNA using primers based on conserved regions between the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans Sma genes, Nakao et al. (1997) cloned a SMAD2 cDNA.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/194072"">194072</a>), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned LMO2, which they designated clone 240495. Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a 1.9-kb LMO2 transcript predominantly expressed in placenta.

Using real-time PCR, Landry et al. (2005) found that LMO2 transcripts originating from the proximal promoter near exon 3 (i.e., short transcripts) dominated in human bone marrow, peripheral blood, and K563 cells and in mouse tissues and cells. Much weaker expression from the distal promoter upstream of exon 1 (i.e., long transcripts) was detected in hematopoietic tissues.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Natkunam et al. (2007) showed that LMO2 was expressed in the nucleus of normal germinal-center (GC) B cells, in GC-derived B-cell lines, and in a subset of GC-derived B-cell lymphomas. LMO2 was also expressed in erythroid and myeloid precursors, in megakaryocytes, and in lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemias. LMO2 was not expressed in any nonhematolymphoid tissues, except for endothelial cells.

Oram et al. (2010) found variable and tissue-specific expression of LMO3 from 3 promoters in normal human endothelial and blood cells, fetal kidney, liver, and thymus, and in T-ALL cell lines. Expression from the intermediate promoter between the distal and proximal promoters was not detected in normal mature T cells, but it was detected in T-ALL samples, with highest expression in cells showing the most primitive phenotype.";chromosomal translocation cell leukemia involving chromosome p disrupts rhombotin gene lmo entry encodes protein duplicated cysteine rich regions called lim domains boehm isolated homolog rhombotin lmo called rhom human mouse rhom highly conserved like rhombotin encode tandem cysteine rich lim domains northern blot analysis showed rhom mrna expressed early mouse development adult central nervous system lung kidney liver spleen low levels thymus searching expressed sequences surrounding cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia specific translocation breakpoint cluster region see cytogenetics royer pokora identified lmo called ttg ttg encodes small cysteine rich protein shares amino acid identity rhombotin screening fetal liver cdna library ttg probe royer pokora identified splice variant ttg prime extension compared previously identified transcript long short ttg transcripts encode identical amino acid proteins tandem lim domains rt pcr suggested expression long transcript erythroid specific whereas expression short transcript ubiquitous searching genes region chromosome associated wagr syndrome entry gawin identified cloned lmo designated clone northern blot analysis several human tissues detected kb lmo transcript predominantly expressed placenta using real time pcr landry found lmo transcripts originating proximal promoter near exon e short transcripts dominated human bone marrow peripheral blood k cells mouse tissues cells much weaker expression distal promoter upstream exon e long transcripts detected hematopoietic tissues using immunohistochemical analysis natkunam showed lmo expressed nucleus normal germinal center gc b cells gc derived b cell lines subset gc derived b cell lymphomas lmo also expressed erythroid myeloid precursors megakaryocytes lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemias lmo expressed nonhematolymphoid tissues except endothelial cells oram found variable tissue specific expression lmo promoters normal human endothelial blood cells fetal kidney liver thymus cell lines expression intermediate promoter distal proximal promoters detected normal mature cells detected samples highest expression cells showing primitive phenotype;0
