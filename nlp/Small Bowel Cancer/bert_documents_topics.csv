Di Fiore et al. (1987) indicated that NEU and HER2 are both the same as ERBB2.

A critical protein kinase lies upstream of MAP kinase and stimulates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinase. Crews et al.

RB1_SNP;0.010920012919923;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

Ullrich and Schlessinger (1990) distinguished 4 classes. One class is represented by the ERBB family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164870"">164870</a>). A second class includes dimeric receptors such as the insulin receptor as well as several protooncogenes such as MET (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>) and ROS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165020"">165020</a>). A third class is characterized by the presence of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and by the interruption of the catalytic domain in 2 parts by a specific hydrophilic 'interkinase' sequence of variable length. This class includes the protooncogene FMS, which encodes the CSF1 receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), which corresponds to the 'white spotting' locus in the mouse, as well as 2 PDGF receptor genes (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>) and FLT1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165070"">165070</a>).

These receptors have strong sequence similarities to the products of the third class but possess only 3 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and a short kinase insert in the intracellular domain. By screening human and mouse testis cDNA libraries with an FMS probe, Rosnet et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNAs encoding human and mouse FLT3, a novel member of the class 3 receptors. FLT3 belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and has strong sequence similarities with other members of the group.

They isolated 7 cDNA clones that corresponded to 7 new non-class I structural genes. Since these genes were located within the hemochromatosis (HFE1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/235200"">235200</a>) candidate gene region, they referred to the genes as HCG (hemochromatosis candidate gene) I-VII. El Kahloun et al. (1993) concluded that HCG I, III, V, and VI are probably single-copy genes situated 180, 155, 140, and 230 kb, respectively, centromeric to HLA-A. There were several copies of the other 3 genes. Each of the genes was associated with a CpG/HTF island.

Using cDNA hybridization selection with a 320-kb YAC containing the HLA-A gene to screen a human duodenal cDNA library, Goei et al. (1994) isolated and characterized 10 novel gene fragments. Also in search of the HFE gene, Yaouanq et al. (1994) identified a zone of linkage disequilibrium which suggested that the HFE gene may reside within a 400-kb expanse of DNA between the locus they referred to as i97 and HLA-F (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/143110"">143110</a>). Totaro et al. (1996) generated a detailed 1.2-Mb physical and transcription map of 6p spanning the HLA class I region from HLA-E to approximately 500 kb telomeric of HLA-F. The localization of known genes was refined, and a new gene from the RNA helicase superfamily was identified. Overall, 14 transcription units in addition to the HLA genes were detected and integrated into the map. Thirteen cDNA fragments showed no similarity with known sequences, and could be candidates for hemochromatosis.

By linkage disequilibrium and full haplotype analysis of hereditary hemochromatosis patients, Feder et al. (1996) identified a 250-kb region more than 3 Mb telomeric of the MHC on chromosome 6 that is identical by descent in 85% of patient chromosomes. Within this region, they identified a gene, which they termed HLA-H, that encodes a predicted 343-amino acid protein related to the MHC class I gene family. The protein comprises a signal sequence, peptide-binding regions (alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains), a transmembrane region, and a small cytoplasmic portion. One of the most conserved structural features of MHC class I molecules in HLA-H are the 4 cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges in the alpha-2 and alpha-3 domains. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb major mRNA transcript in all tissues tested, except brain.

Searching for new human MHC class I related genes, Hashimoto et al. (1995) identified MHC-related protein-1 (MR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600764"">600764</a>) and a second gene, MR2. The HLA-H gene (HFE) reported by Feder et al. (1996) as a candidate gene for hereditary hemochromatosis turned out to be identical to the MR2 gene of Hashimoto et al. (1995). Hashimoto et al. (1997) isolated the murine homolog of this gene. It was found to be similar to its human counterpart with an overall predicted amino acid sequence similarity of approximately 66% and expression in various tissues as in human. An extra 8 amino acid residues between the alpha-1 and the alpha-2 domains in the mouse molecule compared to the human counterpart could be explained by the creation of the additional coding sequence from the intron.

Thenie et al. (2001) isolated an antisense transcript originating from the HFE gene locus. The RNA spans exon 1, exon 2, part of intron 1 of the HFE gene, and 1 kb upstream of it. The antisense transcript is polyadenylated, but displays no open reading frame, and appears to be expressed at low levels in all tissues and cell lines tested.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al.

Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance. The authors speculated that knowledge of the evolutionarily divergent chicken Brca2 sequence may be useful in distinguishing sequence variants from mutations in the human BRCA2 gene.";wooster identified brca gene positional cloning region chromosome q q implicated icelandic families breast cancer entry candidate disease gene likely located kb interval centered around using yeast artificial chromosome p artificial chromosome contigs identify trapped exons within region wooster screened human fetal brain placental monocyte breast cancer cdna libraries identified cdna encoding amino acid protein suggested may represent entire gene northern blot analysis demonstrated expression normal breast epithelial cells placenta breast cancer cell line mcf tavtigian determined complete coding sequence exonic structure brca examined pattern expression composite brca cdna sequence assembled consisted bp include polyadenylation signal poly tail conceptual translation cdna revealed orf beginning nucleotide encoding protein amino acids signal sequence end terminus obvious membrane spanning regions highest levels expression observed breast thymus slightly lower levels lung ovary spleen tavtigian noted brca protein like brca protein entry highly charged roughly one quarter residues acidic basic connor described mouse brca gene sequenced cdna entire amino acid brca protein found like brca brca relatively poorly conserved humans mice approximately brca transcribed diverse range mouse tissues especially testis ovary midgestation embryo brca also expressed mammary gland apparently induced upon pregnancy pattern expression strikingly similar brca warren cloned characterized chicken brca gene gene organized similarly human brca gene compact chicken gene encodes protein amino acids poorly conserved mammalian brca proteins overall amino acid sequence identity human brca however certain domains much highly conserved indicating functional significance authors speculated knowledge evolutionarily divergent chicken brca sequence may useful distinguishing sequence variants mutations human brca gene;0

(1987) identified a gene, which they called glioma-associated oncogene (GLI), that is amplified more than 50-fold in a malignant glioma. The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development. Northern analysis revealed that GLI is expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells but not in most adult tissue. A fragile site of the folic acid type has been described at 12q13.

FBP exhibited DNA binding specificity for the noncoding strand of the FUSE site in vitro. By PCR of human cell line cDNA with degenerate primers based on a partial FBP protein sequence, the authors isolated partial FBP cDNAs. They recovered additional cDNAs from several libraries and used them to assemble a full-length FBP cDNA sequence. The central region of the predicted 644-amino acid protein contains 4 copies of a repeat unit. In vitro binding assays with mutant protein constructs indicated that the third and fourth copies constituted the minimum single-stranded DNA-binding domain. Using potassium permanganate to probe DNA conformation in vivo, Duncan et al. (1994) determined that the pattern of sensitivity of genomic DNA was consistent with the binding of FBP to the noncoding strand of FUSE, which displaced the coding strand. Expression of FBP in human leukemia cells stimulated the activity of a MYC promoter in a FUSE-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of the 2.6-kb FBP mRNA declined upon differentiation, suggesting that FUSE-binding activity may be regulated transcriptionally.

(1989) identified a genomic sequence and a cloned cDNA for a novel receptor-like gene of the PDGF receptor/CSF1 receptor family. The gene recognized a 6.4-kb transcript that was coexpressed in normal human tissues with the 5.3-kb PDGF receptor mRNA. The characteristics of the new receptor were different from the previously known one (PDGFR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>). Matsui et al.

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al. (2003) demonstrated that idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607685"">607685</a>) is often caused by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in fusion of PDGFRA and FIP1L1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607686"">607686</a>), a neighboring gene. The PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that transforms hematopoietic cells and is a therapeutic target of imatinib. Cools et al. (2003) identified the PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene in 9 of 16 patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and in 5 of 9 patients with responses to imatinib that lasted more than 3 months.

Boehm et al. (1991) isolated a homolog of rhombotin, LMO2, which they called RHOM2. Human and mouse RHOM2 are highly conserved and, like rhombotin, encode 2 tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains. Northern blot analysis showed that Rhom2 mRNA was expressed in early mouse development and in adult central nervous system, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen, but only at low levels in thymus.

By searching for expressed sequences surrounding a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)-specific translocation breakpoint cluster region (see CYTOGENETICS), Royer-Pokora et al. (1991) identified LMO2, which they called TTG2. TTG2 encodes a small cysteine-rich protein that shares 48% amino acid identity with rhombotin.

By screening a fetal liver cDNA library with a TTG2 probe, Royer-Pokora et al. (1995) identified a splice variant of TTG2 with a 5-prime extension compared with the previously identified transcript. The long and short TTG2 transcripts encode identical 158-amino acid proteins with tandem LIM domains. RT-PCR suggested that expression of the long transcript was erythroid specific, whereas expression of the short transcript was ubiquitous.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/194072"">194072</a>), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned LMO2, which they designated clone 240495. Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a 1.9-kb LMO2 transcript predominantly expressed in placenta.

Using real-time PCR, Landry et al. (2005) found that LMO2 transcripts originating from the proximal promoter near exon 3 (i.e., short transcripts) dominated in human bone marrow, peripheral blood, and K563 cells and in mouse tissues and cells. Much weaker expression from the distal promoter upstream of exon 1 (i.e., long transcripts) was detected in hematopoietic tissues.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Natkunam et al. (2007) showed that LMO2 was expressed in the nucleus of normal germinal-center (GC) B cells, in GC-derived B-cell lines, and in a subset of GC-derived B-cell lymphomas. LMO2 was also expressed in erythroid and myeloid precursors, in megakaryocytes, and in lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemias. LMO2 was not expressed in any nonhematolymphoid tissues, except for endothelial cells.

Suzuki et al. (1996) described the molecular cloning, chromosomal location, and the transcription of the human GATA6 gene. The cDNA encodes a predicted 449-amino acid protein that is highly conserved among vertebrates and includes 2 adjacent zinc finger/basic domains characteristic of the GATA factor family. The gene is transcribed in a pattern overlapping that of GATA4 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600576"">600576</a>). Transcripts for both of these genes are prominent in heart, pancreas, and ovary, but only GATA6 mRNA was found in lung and liver. GATA6 transcripts were also detected in cultures of human and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. In these cells, GATA6 transcripts were downregulated when quiescent cultures were stimulated to proliferate in response to mitogen activation. The results demonstrate that GATA6 is subject to both tissue-specific and mitogen-responsive regulatory signals. Suzuki et al. (1996) commented that GATA6 is a prime candidate for a gene that regulates the differentiative state of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Kim et al. (2002) reported that MTOR forms a stoichiometric complex with RAPTOR, an evolutionarily conserved protein with at least 2 roles in the MTOR pathway. They cloned the full-length cDNA for RAPTOR, which contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with 1,335 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 149 kD. A previously identified partial cDNA, KIAA1303 (Nagase et al., 2000), is contained within the RAPTOR cDNA. All RAPTOR homologs have a novel N-terminal domain the authors called RNC (RAPTOR N-terminal conserved) that consists of 3 blocks with at least 67 to 79% sequence similarity and is predicted to have a high propensity to form alpha helices. Following the RNC domain, all RAPTOR homologs have 3 HEAT repeats, which are followed by 7 WD40 repeats in the C-terminal third of the protein.
