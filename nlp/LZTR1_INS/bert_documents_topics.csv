One of the enhancer elements contains an AT-rich core sequence (AT motif). To determine the nuclear factor in hepatoma cell lines that interacts with the human AFP enhancer AT motif, Morinaga et al.

This was the largest DNA-binding protein identified to that time and the first protein shown to contain multiple homeodomains and multiple zinc finger motifs. The protein had a predicted mass of 306 kD and contained 4 homeodomains and 17 zinc finger motifs.

Wilks (1989) exploited the existence of 2 highly conserved sequence elements within the catalytic domain to generate PTK-specific degenerate oligonucleotide primers. Wilks et al. (1991) described the primary sequence of new PTKs identified by application of PCR. One, called Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), is a member of a new class of PTKs characterized by the presence of a second phosphotransferase-related domain immediately N-terminal to the PTK domain--hence the name Janus. The second phosphotransferase domain bore all the hallmarks of a protein kinase, although its structure differed significantly from that of the PTK and threonine/serine kinase family members. JAK1 is a large, widely expressed membrane-associated phosphoprotein of approximately 130,000 Da. The PTK activity is located in the C-terminal PTK-like domain; the role of the second kinase-like domain was unknown. A second member of the family, JAK2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147796"">147796</a>), was partially characterized and exhibited a similar array of kinase-related domains.";protein tyrosine kinases ptks large family proteins bears conserved domain amino acids capable phosphorylating substrate proteins tyrosine residues wilks exploited existence highly conserved sequence elements within catalytic domain generate ptk specific degenerate oligonucleotide primers wilks described primary sequence new ptks identified application pcr one called janus kinase jak member new class ptks characterized presence second phosphotransferase related domain immediately n terminal ptk domain hence name janus second phosphotransferase domain bore hallmarks protein kinase although structure differed significantly ptk threonine serine kinase family members jak large widely expressed membrane associated phosphoprotein approximately da ptk activity located c terminal ptk like domain role second kinase like domain unknown second member family jak entry partially characterized exhibited similar array kinase related domains;0

Their finding suggested that the molecular mechanisms of repression by thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors are analogous to the corepressor-dependent transcriptional inhibitory mechanisms of yeast and Drosophila. They suggested that the corepressor is a member of a new gene family, which they termed TRAC (thyroid hormone- and retinoic acid receptor-associated corepressor).";thyroid hormone receptor thr entry retinoic acid receptor rara entry rarb entry rarg entry exert regulatory functions acting activators repressors gene expression horlein identified mouse cdna nuclear receptor corepressor ncor relative molecular mass mediates ligand independent inhibition gene transcription thr rars finding suggested molecular mechanisms repression thyroid hormone retinoic acid receptors analogous corepressor dependent transcriptional inhibitory mechanisms yeast drosophila suggested corepressor member new gene family termed trac thyroid hormone retinoic acid receptor associated corepressor;-1
