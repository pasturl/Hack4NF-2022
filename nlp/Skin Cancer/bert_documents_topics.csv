In addition, p53 appears to induce apoptosis through nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes. In unstressed cells, p53 is kept inactive essentially through the actions of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164785"">164785</a>), which inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and ubiquitinates p53 to promote its degradation. Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity. Activity of p53 is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by mutation of the p53 gene itself or by loss of cell signaling upstream or downstream of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Bourdon, 2007; Vousden and Lane, 2007).";transcription factor p responds diverse cellular stresses regulate target genes induce cell cycle arrest apoptosis senescence dna repair changes metabolism addition p appears induce apoptosis nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes unstressed cells p kept inactive essentially actions ubiquitin ligase mdm entry inhibits p transcriptional activity ubiquitinates p promote degradation numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p activity notably phosphorylation acetylation several less abundant p isoforms also modulate p activity activity p ubiquitously lost human cancer either mutation p gene loss cell signaling upstream downstream p toledo wahl bourdon vousden lane;1

Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance.

MLL is a frequent target for recurrent translocations in acute leukemias that may be characterized as acute myeloid leukemia (AML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601626"">601626</a>), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or mixed lineage (biphenotypic) leukemia (MLL). Leukemias with translocations involving MLL possess unique clinical and biologic characteristics and are often associated with poor prognosis. MLL rearrangements are found in more than 70% of infant leukemias, whether the immunophenotype is more consistent with ALL or AML6, but are less frequent in leukemias from older children. MLL translocations are also found in approximately 10% of AMLs in adults, as well as in therapy-related leukemias, most often characterized as AML, that develop in patients previously treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors for other malignancies. More than 50 different MLL fusion partners have been identified. Leukemogenic MLL translocations encode MLL fusion proteins that have lost H3K4 methyltransferase activity. A key feature of MLL fusion proteins is their ability to efficiently transform hematopoietic cells into leukemia stem cells (Krivtsov and Armstrong, 2007).";kmt gene mll encodes dna binding protein methylates histone h see entry lys h k positively regulates expression target genes including multiple hox genes see entry mll frequent target recurrent translocations acute leukemias may characterized acute myeloid leukemia aml entry acute lymphoblastic leukemia mixed lineage biphenotypic leukemia mll leukemias translocations involving mll possess unique clinical biologic characteristics often associated poor prognosis mll rearrangements found infant leukemias whether immunophenotype consistent aml less frequent leukemias older children mll translocations also found approximately amls adults well therapy related leukemias often characterized aml develop patients previously treated topoisomerase ii inhibitors malignancies different mll fusion partners identified leukemogenic mll translocations encode mll fusion proteins lost h k methyltransferase activity key feature mll fusion proteins ability efficiently transform hematopoietic cells leukemia stem cells krivtsov armstrong;0

(1984) cloned a transforming gene from a chemically transformed human osteosarcoma-derived cell line and mapped it to 7p11.4-qter. Identity to all previously known oncogenes except ERBB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/131550"">131550</a>) was ruled out by the fact that they are encoded by other chromosomes; identity to ERBB is probably excluded by failure of direct hybridizations of the 2 probes. MET was the designation suggested by Cooper et al. (1984).

Dean et al. (1985) showed that MET is in the tyrosine kinase family of oncogenes. It appeared to be most closely related in sequence to the human insulin receptor and ABL oncogene.

From the sequence of MET cDNA, Park et al. (1987) concluded that this oncogene is a cell-surface receptor for a then unknown ligand. The c-Met protooncogene product is a receptor-like tyrosine kinase composed of disulfide-linked subunits of 50 kD (alpha) and 145 kD (beta). In the fully processed c-Met product, the alpha subunit is extracellular, and the beta subunit has extracellular, transmembrane, and tyrosine kinase domains as well as sites of tyrosine phosphorylation.
