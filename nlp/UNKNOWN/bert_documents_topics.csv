The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance.

Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein. CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

RB1_SNP;0.0167116606392414;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al. (2003) demonstrated that idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607685"">607685</a>) is often caused by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in fusion of PDGFRA and FIP1L1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607686"">607686</a>), a neighboring gene.

Ullrich and Schlessinger (1990) distinguished 4 classes. One class is represented by the ERBB family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164870"">164870</a>). A second class includes dimeric receptors such as the insulin receptor as well as several protooncogenes such as MET (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>) and ROS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165020"">165020</a>). A third class is characterized by the presence of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and by the interruption of the catalytic domain in 2 parts by a specific hydrophilic 'interkinase' sequence of variable length. This class includes the protooncogene FMS, which encodes the CSF1 receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), which corresponds to the 'white spotting' locus in the mouse, as well as 2 PDGF receptor genes (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>) and FLT1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165070"">165070</a>).

Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

GATA4_SNP;0.0011176483540246;GATA4;"GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 4; GATA4";live;"The GATA-binding proteins are a group of structurally related transcription factors that control gene expression and differentiation in a variety of cell types. Members of this family of DNA-binding proteins recognize a consensus sequence known as the 'GATA' motif, which is an important cis-element in the promoters of many genes (Arceci et al., 1993). All GATA-binding proteins contain 1 or 2 zinc finger motifs of the distinctive form CXNCX(17)CNXC (Evans et al., 1988). GATA1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/305371"">305371</a>), the founding member of the family, is expressed in erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and other hematopoietic cells. It regulates expression of genes critical for erythroid development, such as the globin genes. GATA2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137295"">137295</a>) is expressed in hematopoietic cells and numerous other cell types. This factor has been implicated in the regulation of endothelial gene expression and hematopoiesis. GATA3 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/131320"">131320</a>) is expressed in brain and T cells and appears to control expression of T-cell receptor genes.

APO1 was expressed on the cell surface of various normal and malignant cells, including activated human T and B lymphocytes and a variety of malignant human lymphoid cell lines, and binding of anti-APO1 antibody to the APO1 antigen induced apoptosis.

<Subhead> Antisense Transcript SAF

Yan et al. (2005) described a novel RNA transcribed from the opposite strand of intron 1 of the human FAS gene, which they named SAF. The 1.5-kb transcript was expressed in human heart, placenta, liver, muscle, and pancreas, as well as in several cancer cell lines. SAF-transfected Jurkat cells were highly resistant to FAS-mediated but not to TNF-alpha (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/191160"">191160</a>)-mediated apoptosis, compared to control transfectants. Although the overall mRNA expression level of FAS was not affected, expression of some novel forms of FAS transcripts was increased in SAF-transfected cells. Yan et al. (2005) hypothesized that SAF may protect T lymphocytes from FAS-mediated apoptosis by blocking the binding of FASL or its agonistic FAS antibody, and that SAF may regulate expression of FAS alternative splice forms through pre-mRNA processing.";itoh isolated cdnas encoding human fas antigen human cell lymphoma cdna library sequence analysis predicted amino acid signal sequence followed mature protein amino acids single transmembrane domain molecular mass approximately kd fas antigen shows structural homology number cell surface receptors including tumor necrosis factor tnf receptors entry entry low affinity nerve growth factor receptor ngfr entry northern blot analysis detected kb fas mrnas thymus liver ovary heart functional expression studies mouse cells showed fas antigen induced antibody triggered apoptosis watanabe fukunaga isolated mouse fas antigen murine macrophage cdna library deduced amino acid sequence shares sequence identity human sequence northern blot analysis detected kb fas antigen mrna mouse thymus heart liver ovary oehm demonstrated kd apo antigen defined mouse monoclonal antibody anti apo fas antigen apo expressed cell surface various normal malignant cells including activated human b lymphocytes variety malignant human lymphoid cell lines binding anti apo antibody apo antigen induced apoptosis subhead antisense transcript saf yan described novel rna transcribed opposite strand intron human fas gene named saf kb transcript expressed human heart placenta liver muscle pancreas well several cancer cell lines saf transfected jurkat cells highly resistant fas mediated tnf alpha entry mediated apoptosis compared control transfectants although overall mrna expression level fas affected expression novel forms fas transcripts increased saf transfected cells yan hypothesized saf may protect lymphocytes fas mediated apoptosis blocking binding fasl agonistic fas antibody saf may regulate expression fas alternative splice forms pre mrna processing;13
