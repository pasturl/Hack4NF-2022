In addition, p53 appears to induce apoptosis through nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes. In unstressed cells, p53 is kept inactive essentially through the actions of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164785"">164785</a>), which inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and ubiquitinates p53 to promote its degradation. Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity. Activity of p53 is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by mutation of the p53 gene itself or by loss of cell signaling upstream or downstream of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Bourdon, 2007; Vousden and Lane, 2007).";transcription factor p responds diverse cellular stresses regulate target genes induce cell cycle arrest apoptosis senescence dna repair changes metabolism addition p appears induce apoptosis nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes unstressed cells p kept inactive essentially actions ubiquitin ligase mdm entry inhibits p transcriptional activity ubiquitinates p promote degradation numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p activity notably phosphorylation acetylation several less abundant p isoforms also modulate p activity activity p ubiquitously lost human cancer either mutation p gene loss cell signaling upstream downstream p toledo wahl bourdon vousden lane;1

Using the ALL1 SET domain as a probe, Prasad et al. (1997) cloned a novel gene, KMT2D, which they designated ALR (ALL1-related gene). The gene encodes a 5,262-amino acid protein containing a SET domain, 5 PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a long run of glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues (mostly leucine). They also detected an alternatively spliced form encoding 4,957 amino acids and lacking an N-terminal zinc finger and PHD finger. Analysis of ALR expression showed that its approximately 18-kb transcript is expressed, like ALL1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic cells, but not in liver. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of early mouse embryos indicated expression of a similar mouse gene in multiple tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern, Prasad et al.

RB1_SNP;0.0076476168722794;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

The expression of this protein (CDKN2B) was induced approximately 30-fold in human keratinocytes by treatment with TGF-beta, suggesting that p15 may act as an effector of TGFB-mediated cell cycle arrest. Comparison of the sequence of the gene encoding p15(INK4B) with that reported for MTS2 (Kamb et al., 1994) demonstrated that the MTS2 sequence encodes the C-terminal 86 amino acids of p15(INK4B). MTS2 was found by Kamb et al.

The yeast Rad50, Mre11 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600814"">600814</a>), and Xrs2 proteins appear to act in a multiprotein complex, consistent with the observation that mutations in these genes confer nearly identical phenotypes of no meiotic recombination and elevated rates of homologous mitotic recombination. By direct selection of cDNAs from the 5q23-q31 chromosomal interval, Dolganov et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding a human Rad50 homolog. The human RAD50 gene spans 100 to 130 kb.

(1987) identified a gene, which they called glioma-associated oncogene (GLI), that is amplified more than 50-fold in a malignant glioma. The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development. Northern analysis revealed that GLI is expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells but not in most adult tissue. A fragile site of the folic acid type has been described at 12q13.
