Dean et al. (1985) showed that MET is in the tyrosine kinase family of oncogenes. It appeared to be most closely related in sequence to the human insulin receptor and ABL oncogene.

Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al. (2003) demonstrated that idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607685"">607685</a>) is often caused by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in fusion of PDGFRA and FIP1L1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607686"">607686</a>), a neighboring gene. The PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that transforms hematopoietic cells and is a therapeutic target of imatinib. Cools et al. (2003) identified the PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene in 9 of 16 patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and in 5 of 9 patients with responses to imatinib that lasted more than 3 months. Relapse in one patient correlated with the appearance of a thr674-to-ile mutation in the PDGFRA gene (T674I; {173490.0008}) that conferred resistance to imatinib.";matsui identified genomic sequence cloned cdna novel receptor like gene pdgf receptor csf receptor family gene recognized kb transcript coexpressed normal human tissues kb pdgf receptor mrna characteristics new receptor different previously known one pdgfr entry matsui suggested existence genes encoding pdgf receptors interact distinct manner different pdgf isoforms may confer regulatory flexibility functional responses pdgf subhead pdgfra fusion genes chronic myeloid leukemia cml entry characterized presence bcr entry abl entry fusion gene usually association q q chromosomal translocation baxter reported identification cloning rare variant translocation q q patients cml like myeloproliferative disease unusual frame bcr pdgfra fusion mrna identified patients either bcr exon exon fused short bcr intron derived sequences turn fused part pdgfra exon sequencing genomic breakpoint junctions showed chromosome breakpoints fell bcr introns whereas chromosome breakpoints within pdgfra exon cools demonstrated idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome entry often caused interstitial deletion chromosome q resulting fusion pdgfra fip l entry neighboring gene pdgfra fip l gene constitutively activated tyrosine kinase transforms hematopoietic cells therapeutic target imatinib cools identified pdgfra fip l gene patients idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome patients responses imatinib lasted months relapse one patient correlated appearance thr ile mutation pdgfra gene conferred resistance imatinib;0

One of the best characterized targets of PI3K lipid products is the protein kinase AKT, or protein kinase B (PKB). In quiescent cells, PKB resides in the cytosol in a low-activity conformation. Upon cellular stimulation, PKB is activated through recruitment to cellular membranes by PI3K lipid products and by phosphorylation by 3-prime phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/605213"">605213</a>).

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Gibbons and Higgs (2000) stated that the XH2 gene encodes at least 2 alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts that differ at the 5-prime ends and give rise to slightly different proteins of 265 and 280 kD, respectively.";stayton described cloning characterization gene provisionally called x linked helicase xh located chromosome xq gene undergoes x inactivation contains kb open reading frame encodes putative ntp binding nuclear protein homologous several members helicase ii superfamily situ hybridization studies mouse revealed precocious widespread expression murine homolog xh early stages embryogenesis restricted expression late developmental stages birth xh shares conserved collinear domains members family proven putative helicases particular xh protein shows homology rad type ii helicases implicated nucleotide excision repair initiation transcription picketts established full length sequence atrx cdna predicted structure atrx protein comparative analysis showed atrx member snf like subgroup superfamily proteins similar atpase helicase domains see entry n terminal region contains nuclear localization signal antibody studies indicated nuclear localization protein c terminal region glutamine rich common attribute transcription factors addition amino acid segment p element c terminal region shows similarity snf like proteins involved gene expression villard determined atrx gene encodes predicted protein amino acids three zinc finger motifs found within prime end gene expression analysis different tissues identified alternative splicing event involves exon one alternatively spliced transcripts expressed predominantly embryonic tissues gibbons used n terminal sequence atrx identified picketts identify cysteine rich motif similar putative zinc finger domain cys cys called phd finger phd motifs span amino acids identified proteins many implicated chromatin mediated transcriptional control picketts showed mouse atrx gene shows structural features similar human gene two highly conserved functionally important regions identified potential finger domain n terminus catalytic domain c terminus gibbons higgs stated xh gene encodes least alternatively spliced mrna transcripts differ prime ends give rise slightly different proteins kd respectively;0

HGF_SNP;0.0103678096890673;HGF;"HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR; HGF";live;"Plasma from patients with fulminant hepatic failure contains a factor that stimulates the growth of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

Therefore, Karn et al. (1993) called the novel gene TKT (pronounced 'ticket') for 'tyrosine-kinase related to TRK.' TKT orthologs from man and mouse are 98% similar. Northern blot analysis detected a 10-kb transcript that was highly expressed in heart and lung, with lower expression in brain, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. In mouse, highest expression was also detected in heart and lung, with lower expression in brain and testis.

Using in situ hybridization with 1-week-old mice, Labrador et al. (2001) found that Ddr2 was expressed along chondrocyte columns in the proliferative region of the growth plate.

Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein. CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene.

In general, however, mammalian PTPases can be subdivided into 1 of 2 broad categories: (1) transmembrane receptor PTPases that contain linked cytoplasmic catalytic domains, and (2) intracellular PTPases. Included within the latter category are 2 closely related mammalian intracellular PTPases whose sequences encode 2 tandem SRC homology 2 (SH2) domains that are located at the amino-terminal side of a single PTPase catalytic domain.

Ullrich and Schlessinger (1990) distinguished 4 classes. One class is represented by the ERBB family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164870"">164870</a>). A second class includes dimeric receptors such as the insulin receptor as well as several protooncogenes such as MET (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>) and ROS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165020"">165020</a>). A third class is characterized by the presence of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and by the interruption of the catalytic domain in 2 parts by a specific hydrophilic 'interkinase' sequence of variable length. This class includes the protooncogene FMS, which encodes the CSF1 receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), which corresponds to the 'white spotting' locus in the mouse, as well as 2 PDGF receptor genes (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>) and FLT1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165070"">165070</a>).

Tsujimoto et al.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

<Subhead> BRAG1: A Spurious 'BCL2-related' Gene

The open reading frame of the BRAG1 gene encoded a protein of 31 kD. Using a bacterial expression vector, Das et al.

Also, protein phosphorylation is involved in membrane excitability and the function of ion channels. Lev et al. (1995) discovered a nonreceptor type protein kinase that is highly expressed in adult rat brain. The kinase, which they symbolized PYK2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2), was cloned from a rat spinal cord cDNA library using degenerate PCR primers corresponding to conserved tyrosine kinase motifs of PYK1 (see Manser et al., 1993). Lev et al. (1995) cloned the human homolog from a human fetal brain cDNA library using the rat sequence as a probe.

It contains domains that share similarity with microtubule-associated proteins, as well as a leucine zipper identical to that found in Drosophila centrosomin (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/602039"">602039</a>). Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5- to 8.0-kb transcript in most rat tissues examined; testis-, heart-, and skeletal muscle-specific variants were also detected. Western blot analysis detected myomegalin at about 62 kD in testis and at 230 to 250 kD in heart and skeletal muscle. Immunocytochemistry and transfection studies demonstrated colocalization of myomegalin with Pde4d in the Golgi/centrosomal area of cultured cells and in sarcomeric structures of skeletal muscle.

By analyzing ESTs for cardiac muscle-specific transcripts, followed by screening heart cDNA libraries and 5-prime RACE, Soejima et al.

(1987) identified a gene, which they called glioma-associated oncogene (GLI), that is amplified more than 50-fold in a malignant glioma. The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development. Northern analysis revealed that GLI is expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells but not in most adult tissue. A fragile site of the folic acid type has been described at 12q13.

The predicted 467-amino acid polypeptide, which the authors called JV18-1, shows maximal homology to Mad genes at the amino and carboxy termini of the protein, with 62% identity to Mad over 373 amino acids. Drosophila Mad apparently acts downstream of the TGF-beta receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/190181"">190181</a>) to transduce signals from the members of the TGF-beta gene family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/190180"">190180</a>). The gene product shows 44% identity over 158 amino acids to another Mad homolog, DPC4 (SMAD4; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600993"">600993</a>).

Graff et al. (1996) described a family of Xenopus proteins homologous to the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans CEM genes. MAD and MAD-related proteins are important components of the serine/threonine kinase receptor signal transduction pathways. Eppert et al. (1996) cloned and characterized a member of this family, which they designated MADR2. The gene encodes a 467-amino acid protein that contains no common structural motifs known at that time. MADR2 shares high homology with MADR1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601595"">601595</a>) and significant homology with DPC4. They reported that MADR2 is rapidly phosphorylated by activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.

By RT-PCR of human erythroleukemia cell mRNA using primers based on conserved regions between the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans Sma genes, Nakao et al. (1997) cloned a SMAD2 cDNA. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitously expressed 3.4- and 2.9-kb SMAD2 transcripts. The encoded protein has a molecular mass of 58 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Baker and Harland (1996) identified the mouse Madr2 gene using a functional assay to clone mouse mesoderm inducers from Xenopus ectoderm. The mouse amino acid sequence is 46% identical to the human tumor suppressor DPC4. Madr2 was expressed widely in the mouse embryo (with the exception of heart and the tail bud) from embryonic days 6.5 to 10.5. Madr2 was found to be confined to the nucleus in the deep anterior cells of the second axis, whereas it was localized in the cytoplasm in the epidermal and more posterior cells.

Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. Imbalances in glutamatergic function have been implicated in neuronal death following ischemia, in hypoglycemia or anoxia, in epilepsy, and in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate actions are mediated by glutamate receptors which fall into 2 distinct classes: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels whose responses to selective agonists define the N-methyl-D-aspartate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxasole-4-propionate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138248"">138248</a>), and kainate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138245"">138245</a>) subtypes.

A critical protein kinase lies upstream of MAP kinase and stimulates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinase. Crews et al.

This localization may occur by means of specific interactions between synaptic membrane proteins and a variety of anchoring or clustering molecules. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the intracellular C-terminal tail of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit (GRIN1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), Lin et al. (1998) isolated human brain cDNAs encoding a novel protein. The presumed full-length coding sequence encodes a predicted 1,642-amino acid protein containing many long coiled-coil regions throughout its length. Due to its coiled-coil structure, the authors named the protein 'yotiao,' after a popular Chinese breakfast food consisting of long strands of fried dough. The interaction of yotiao with NR1 is dependent upon the presence of the 37-amino acid region in the C-terminal tail of NR1 that is encoded by the alternatively spliced C1 exon cassette of NR1. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected an 11-kb yotiao transcript that was expressed abundantly in skeletal muscle and pancreas, to a lesser degree in heart and placenta, and modestly in brain. Immunohistochemical experiments indicated that yotiao is expressed in a somatodendritic pattern in neurons throughout the rat brain, with prominent expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The authors demonstrated that yotiao and NR1 are colocalized in rat brain. Yotiao is predominantly located at the neuromuscular junction in rat skeletal muscle. Biochemical studies showed that yotiao fractionates with cytoskeleton-associated proteins and with the postsynaptic density. Lin et al. (1998) concluded that yotiao is an NR1-binding protein that is potentially involved in the cytoskeletal attachment of NMDA receptors.

By overlay screening with RII (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/176910"">176910</a>), database searches, and PCR of a Jurkat T-lymphocyte expression library, Witczak et al.

The N-terminal 1,626 amino acids are identical to yotiao except for a 12-amino acid stretch not found in yotiao. The 2 proteins are alternatively spliced products of the AKAP9 gene. Northern blot analysis revealed a 12-kb transcript expressed in most tissues tested, with highest levels in kidney, intermediate levels in brain, heart, placenta, and lung, and low levels in skeletal muscle, liver, small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Prominent smearing suggested a high level of mRNA degradation. Hybridization with a more 3-prime probe revealed a transcript of about 8 kb that was prominently expressed in liver and kidney. Immunofluorescence localization showed staining of a single perinuclear dot in interphase HeLa cells and staining of 2 polarized dots in metaphase cells. Dual labeling of HeLa cells and Western blot analysis of purified centrosomes from a human lymphoblast cell line confirmed that AKAP9 localized to centrosomes. Western blot analysis revealed 4 distinct proteins in centrosome preparations, with the highest molecular mass protein migrating at about 450 kD.

Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest expression of a 14.5-kb transcript in spleen, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Upon overexposure, low levels were also detected in brain, heart, liver, lung, and testis. All tissues showed smearing of the Akap9 transcript.

The translocation involves the TCR-delta locus (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186810"">186810</a>) on 14q11 and also a transcribed sequence on 11p15. They found that the gene on 11p15 is normally expressed in rhombomeres of the developing hindbrain. The gene product, designated rhombosine or rhombotin, has 155 amino acids and no homology to any previously described protein.

Because human and mouse rhombotin are virtually identical in derived protein sequence, rendering it difficult to identify functionally important regions or motifs, Boehm et al. (1990) isolated and compared rhombotin sequences from disparate species. They showed a sequence that is highly homologous to that of human and mouse rhombotin in Drosophila DNA. This comparison and others suggested that rhombotin, which lacks a DNA-binding homeodomain, may belong to a new class of transcriptional regulators that modulate transcription via intermolecular competitive binding to certain DNA-binding transcription factors. The structure of the predicted rhombotin protein suggests that it consists of 2 tandemly arranged cysteine-rich regions, which were subsequently identified in 3 transcription factors appended to putative DNA binding and activation domains, wherein they were termed LIM domains. The function of LIM domains may be in protein-protein interaction. LIM domains show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Consistent with its close structural homology to the human gene, the mouse homolog Ttg1 maps to chromosome 7, distal to the beta-globin locus (Angel et al., 1993).

Boehm et al. (1991) isolated 2 homologs of the rhombotin gene. Rhombotin-2 (RBTN2; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180385"">180385</a>) is located close to the T-ALL breakpoint cluster region on 11p13. This was determined by mapping to chromosome 11 by hybridization to a somatic cell that contained only human chromosome 11 and thereafter by hybridizing the human rhombotin exon-2-specific probe to cosmid clones spanning about 100 kb around the T-ALL breakpoint cluster region. Rhom-2 in the mouse is similar to the human homolog. Boehm et al. (1991) identified a third rhombotin-like gene (RBTN3; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180386"">180386</a>) and determined that it is not situated on chromosome 11. It shows, however, 93% homology with rhombotin-2 and also encodes a LIM domain protein. It is not known whether the RHOM3 gene is associated with chromosomal abnormalities in leukemia.

Homologs of this gene have been identified in several species, including mouse and human. Pittman et al. (1998) reported the identification of a novel member of the RAD51 gene family in both mouse and human. The mouse cDNA, Rad51d, isolated by screening EST databases with yeast RAD55 and human RAD51B amino acid sequences, encodes a predicted 329-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 35,260 Da. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of multiple transcripts of the Rad51d gene in all tissues examined. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from 7 mammalian species demonstrated that the RAD51D gene is conserved. Pittman et al. (1998) used the mouse nucleotide sequence to screen a human EST database and identified 2 RAD51D cDNA clones from human T-lymphocyte and placenta libraries; both cDNAs appeared to be variants of the mouse gene. The shorter cDNA represented an alternatively spliced product and excluded sequences corresponding to 2 exons in the mouse gene, one of which encodes the first ATP-binding motif. The longer cDNA skipped a single exon present in the mouse gene, resulting in a frameshift and a predicted truncated protein. The authors stated that if the frameshift is ignored, the full-length putative 289-amino acid protein shares 71% sequence identity with the predicted mouse protein, and the mouse and human RAD51D genes have 2 conserved ATP-binding domains similar to other RecA-related genes.

Cartwright et al. (1998) also isolated human and mouse RAD51L3, or R51H3, cDNAs. They found that the sequence of the predicted 328-amino acid human protein is 82% identical to that of mouse RAD51L3.

(1994) isolated a cDNA encoding SETDB1, which they called KIAA0067. The deduced SETDB1 protein has 1,291 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected SETDB1 expression in all 16 human tissues examined.

The SET domain is a highly conserved, approximately 150-amino acid motif implicated in the modulation of chromatin structure. It was originally identified as part of a larger conserved region present in the Drosophila Trithorax protein and was subsequently identified in the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and 'Enhancer of zeste' proteins, from which the acronym SET is derived. Studies have suggested that the SET domain may be a signature of proteins that modulate transcriptionally active or repressed chromatin states through chromatin remodeling activities. In the course of searching sequence databases for proteins containing SET domains, Harte et al. (1999) identified the SETDB1 sequence. They determined that SETDB1 has a C-terminal SET domain that is well-conserved except that it contains a 347-amino acid insertion between its most highly conserved regions. The authors found that the C. elegans YNCA gene product is highly similar to SETDB1 and also contains a bifurcated SET domain.

(2002) identified a gene encoding a large, receptor-like protein as the site of mutations causing autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (PKD4; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/263200"">263200</a>), also known as polycystic kidney and hepatic disease-1, and designated the protein fibrocystin. Identification of the gene came from study of a rat model in which the gene for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease mapped to rat chromosome 9 in a region of syntenic homology to a portion of the human chromosome 6 containing the locus for ARPKD. The PKHD1 open reading frame is 12,222 basepairs and encodes a protein of 4,074 amino acids. Ward et al. (2002) found that the PKHD1 transcript, approximately 16 kb long, is expressed at moderate levels in adult kidney and pancreas, with lower expression in liver. Moderate expression was also detected in fetal kidney. The large protein encoded by PKHD1 contains multiple copies of a domain, TIG, shared with plexins and transcription factors. It was thought that fibrocystin may be a receptor protein that acts in collecting duct and biliary differentiation.

Onuchic et al. (2002) identified several distinct PKHD1 transcripts containing unique combinations of exons. The transcript with the longest open reading frame encoded a deduced 4,074-amino acid integral membrane protein, which the authors designated polyductin. This protein has a 3,858-amino acid extracellular N terminus, a single transmembrane (TM) domain, and a short C terminus. The extracellular region contains 6 immunoglobulin-like plexin (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601055"">601055</a>)-transcription factor (IPT) domains, followed by at least 9 HbH1 repeats, which are commonly associated with polysaccharidases. It also has multiple potential N-glycosylation sites, an RGD domain, and 3 putative cAMP/cGMP phosphorylation sites. The other PKHD1 gene products were predicted to fall into 2 broad groups: those that encode proteins containing the TM element, which are likely to be associated with the plasma membrane, and those that encode proteins lacking the TM domain, which are likely to be secreted. Northern blot analysis detected a smear of transcripts from 8.5 to 13 kb, with highest expression in adult and fetal kidney.

All SNF2 family proteins contain the approximately 400-amino acid SNF2 domain, which has 7 motifs that are similar to motifs found in helicases. The SNF2 domain contains a nucleotide-binding site, a phosphate-binding loop (also called Walker A and B boxes), a DEAD box, and DNA- and ATP-binding motifs.

Huebner et al. (1988) found that the locus is discontinuous in human cells and is composed of 3 major genetic elements originating 5-prime to 3-prime from human chromosomes 5, 18, and 17. Nakamura et al. (1992) cloned transcripts from the chromosome 17 portion of TRE from a cDNA library of cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA from TRE-transfected NIH 3T3 tumor cells. They obtained a novel cDNA, the 5-prime part of which overlapped the TRE transcript, and named its locus of origin TRE2. The complete cDNA spans 8,201 bp and possesses an unusually long noncoding region and a translatable region with 2 open reading frames (ORF). In 1 cDNA clone, the presence of 2 insertion sequences suggested the possibility of alternative splicing. Transfection-tumorigenicity assays with the ORFs subcloned into expression vectors were positive for the ORF adjacent to the 5-prime noncoding region and negative for the second, downstream ORF. Analysis of the 786-amino acid sequence deduced from the 5-prime ORF predicted a highly hydrophilic protein with 2 charge clusters suggesting nucleic acid-binding properties. When used as a probe, the cloned sequence detected RNA transcripts in a wide variety of human cancer cells regardless of their lineage of origin from different tissues, but not in human cells from normal tissue.

Gene duplication and domain accretion are thought to be the major mechanism for the emergence of novel genes during evolution. Genomic sequence analysis has demonstrated extensive amplification events during the evolution of higher primates. Paulding et al. (2003) reported that the USP6 oncogene is derived from the chimeric fusion of 2 genes, USP32 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607740"">607740</a>) and TBC1D3 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607741"">607741</a>). USP32 is an ancient highly conserved gene, whereas TBC1D3 is derived from a recent segmental duplication that is absent in most other mammals and shows rapid amplification and dispersal through the primate lineage. The chimeric gene USP6 exists only in the hominoid lineage of primates and arose as recently as 21 to 33 million years ago, after proliferation of the TBC1D3 segmental duplication in the primate lineage. Paulding et al. (2003) determined that the full-length USP6 gene encodes a 1,406-amino acid protein. Amino acids 1 to 496 are derived from TBC1D3 and encompass a TBC domain. Amino acids 501 to 1406 are derived from USP32 and encompass a ubiquitin-specific protease domain. In contrast to the broad expression patterns of USP32 and TBC1D3, RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of USP6 is testis-specific, a pattern proposed for genes implicated in the emergence of reproductive barriers. The authors concluded that the sudden emergence of chimeric proteins, such as that encoded by USP6, may have contributed to hominoid speciation.";tre locus first isolated nih cells transfected human ewing sarcoma dna nakamura huebner found locus discontinuous human cells composed major genetic elements originating prime prime human chromosomes nakamura cloned transcripts chromosome portion tre cdna library cytoplasmic poly rna tre transfected nih tumor cells obtained novel cdna prime part overlapped tre transcript named locus origin tre complete cdna spans bp possesses unusually long noncoding region translatable region open reading frames orf cdna clone presence insertion sequences suggested possibility alternative splicing transfection tumorigenicity assays orfs subcloned expression vectors positive orf adjacent prime noncoding region negative second downstream orf analysis amino acid sequence deduced prime orf predicted highly hydrophilic protein charge clusters suggesting nucleic acid binding properties used probe cloned sequence detected rna transcripts wide variety human cancer cells regardless lineage origin different tissues human cells normal tissue gene duplication domain accretion thought major mechanism emergence novel genes evolution genomic sequence analysis demonstrated extensive amplification events evolution higher primates paulding reported usp oncogene derived chimeric fusion genes usp entry tbc entry usp ancient highly conserved gene whereas tbc derived recent segmental duplication absent mammals shows rapid amplification dispersal primate lineage chimeric gene usp exists hominoid lineage primates arose recently million years ago proliferation tbc segmental duplication primate lineage paulding determined full length usp gene encodes amino acid protein amino acids derived tbc encompass tbc domain amino acids derived usp encompass ubiquitin specific protease domain contrast broad expression patterns usp tbc rt pcr analysis showed expression usp testis specific pattern proposed genes implicated emergence reproductive barriers authors concluded sudden emergence chimeric proteins encoded usp may contributed hominoid speciation;0

Type 1 transporters, such as NPT1 (SLC17A1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/182308"">182308</a>), are found mainly in kidney and do not appear to be regulated by dietary phosphate levels. Type 2 transporters can be subdivided into 2 groups based on sequence similarity and tissue distribution. One group, which includes NaPi3 (SLC34A1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/182309"">182309</a>), consists of transporters that are found almost exclusively in the renal proximal tubule, whereas the second group consists of transporters that are more widely distributed. Type 3 transporters can also function as membrane receptors for primate retroviruses. By searching an EST database for cDNAs that show sequence similarity to NaPi3, Feild et al. (1999) identified a human small intestine cDNA encoding the novel phosphate transporter SLC34A2, which they named NaPi3B. They isolated a full-length SLC34A2 cDNA from both human small intestine and lung cDNAs. The deduced 690-amino acid SLC34A2 protein is a type 2 phosphate transporter. It contains 8 predicted transmembrane domains and a cysteine-rich N-terminal region. SLC34A2 shares 78% amino acid identity with the mouse sodium-dependent phosphate transporter IIb. Functional studies showed that SLC34A2 is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter that is strongly sensitive to pH, with phosphate uptake increased at more acidic pH. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb SLC34A2 transcript in several human tissues of epithelial origin; kidney also contained high levels of a 2.4-kb transcript.

(1995) used mosaic flies to screen for tumor suppressors or negative regulators of cell proliferation. The cellular composition of these flies resembled that of cancer patients who are chimeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic cells. One of the genes they identified was the 'large tumor suppressor' gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive proliferation and form large tumors in many tissues in mosaic adults. Mutants homozygous for various lats alleles display a range of developmental defects, including embryonic lethality. Although many tumor suppressors were identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it was not clear whether these fly genes were directly relevant to tumorigenesis in mammals.

To identify genes whose transcription might be repressed during the genesis of neuroblastomas, Shtivelman and Bishop (1991) used subtractive cDNA cloning to detect genes expressed in human melanomas and pheochromocytomas but not in neuroblastomas. The first of these genes identified encoded the cell surface protein CD44 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/107269"">107269</a>), an integral membrane glycoprotein that is the principal receptor for hyaluronate on the cell surface. A second gene, originally designated PM227, attracted their attention because its expression appeared to be coordinated with that of CD44. Shtivelman et al. (1992) reported that PM227 encodes a protein whose exceptionally large size of 700 kD caused them to rename the gene AHNAK (meaning 'giant' in Hebrew). The amino acid sequence of AHNAK suggested secondary structure with a periodicity of 2.33 residues per turn. Individual chains could associate to form a 7- or 8-stranded barrel. The resulting structure would be a polyionic rod with length as great as 1.2 microns. Preliminary evidence indicated that the protein resides predominantly within the nucleus, but no function had been discerned. The highly conserved repeated elements were, for the most part, 128 amino acids long.

(1993) cloned human DDR1, which they called DDR. The predicted protein contains 913 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 105 kD. It has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions. The extracellular region contains a discoidin I-like domain, a pro/gly-rich region, 4 putative N-glycosylation sites, and 7 cysteines. The cytoplasmic domain contains a pro/gly-rich region and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.0-kb transcript in multiple human cell lines, with highest expression in breast carcinoma cell lines and an epidermoid carcinoma cell line. Expression was also detected in several mouse tissues, with highest levels in kidney, spleen, and placenta. Immunoblot analysis revealed a 120-kD DDR protein in transfected COS-7 cells. The DDR protein was detected in human breast carcinoma cell lines, but not in a variety of other human cell lines.

Using PCR to identify protein tyrosine kinases in HeLa cells, Perez et al. (1994) obtained a cDNA encoding DDR1, which they they called CAK. The deduced 913-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 101 kD. It has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic receptor tyrosine kinase domain. The N-terminal extracellular domain shares similarity with phospholipid-binding sequences found in cell adhesion molecules, such as neuronal A5 antigen and factors V (F5; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/612309"">612309</a>) and VIII (F8; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300841"">300841</a>), and it has 7 cysteines, 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, and a furin (FUR; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/136950"">136950</a>) cleavage site (RxRR). The C-terminal kinase domain contains motifs characteristic of a receptor tyrosine kinase, including a canonical GxGxxG sequence of the ATP-binding loop and 4 tyrosine phosphorylation sites, 3 of which may be autophosphorylated. Northern blot analysis detected a 5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in brain and lung. CAK expression was also detected in mouse brain and in several human cell lines.

By screening a keratinocyte cDNA library with the catalytic domain of TRKA (NTRK1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/191315"">191315</a>), followed by screening fetal brain and keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Di Marco et al. (1993) cloned a splice variant of DDR1 that they designated TRKE. The deduced 876-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by an extracellular domain with 5 consensus N-glycosylation sites and 7 cysteines, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with a kinase catalytic domain that includes an ATP-binding site and a putative autophosphorylation site. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.9-kb TRKE transcript in human keratinocytes and in all adult and fetal human tissues examined except liver.

Using PCR, Laval et al. (1994) cloned a splice variant of DDR1 that they called RTK6 from a human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line. The deduced 876-amino acid protein, which is identical to TRKE (Di Marco et al., 1993), has a calculated molecular mass of 97 kD. Compared with the DDR protein (Johnson et al., 1993), RTK6 lacks 37 amino acids between the transmembrane region and the catalytic domain. Northern blot analysis detected high expression of a 4.5-kb RTK6 transcript in brain, with lower expression in heart, placenta, lung, liver, muscle, kidney, and pancreas. RT-PCR detected expression of both DDR and RTK6 in placenta and in all ovarian cell lines tested. In situ hybridization detected RTK6 in epithelial cells of human ovary, small intestine, thymus, fetal lung, fetal kidney, and gray matter of fetal brain. RTK6 was expressed at high levels in moderately and poorly differentiated malignant ovarian tumors and at lower levels in normal, benign, and borderline tumors. Western blot analysis detected RTK6 at an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD, suggesting that the fully processed, mature protein is glycosylated.

Playford et al. (1996) identified 2 splice variants of DDR1, which they called EDDR1 and EDDR2. EDDR1 lacks exon 11 and corresponds to TRKE/RTK6 (Di Marco et al., 1993; Laval et al., 1994). EDDR2 uses a cryptic splice site in the 5-prime region of exon 14, resulting in an in-frame addition of 6 amino acids in the catalytic domain compared with DDR.

Edelhoff et al. (1995) noted that DDR1 shares 93% amino acid identity with its putative mouse homolog, Nep, also called Ptk3. Nep is widely expressed in fetal and adult mouse tissues.

The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line UV40 exhibits hypersensitivity not only to ionizing radiation but also to UV radiation, simple alkylating agents, and DNA crosslinking agents. It also shows pronounced spontaneous chromosomal instability and an elevated level of sister chromatid exchange (SCE). By functional complementation of UV40 cells, Liu et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA, termed XRCC9, that confers resistance to both hygromycin and mitomycin C. XRCC9 contains a 5-prime GC-rich untranslated region characteristic of housekeeping genes. The putative 622-amino acid protein has a leucine zipper motif at its N terminus, but the authors found no significant similarity to any known protein. By Northern blot analysis, a 2.5-kb XRCC9 mRNA band was present in HeLa and AA8 cells but not in UV cells. In human and baboon tissues, 2 major mRNA bands of 2.2 and 2.5 kb were detected, with highest levels in testis and thymus in human, and in testis in baboon.;rodent cell lines hypersensitive ionizing radiation assigned least complementation groups human genes correct mutants given xrcc designation chinese hamster ovary cho cell line uv exhibits hypersensitivity ionizing radiation also uv radiation simple alkylating agents dna crosslinking agents also shows pronounced spontaneous chromosomal instability elevated level sister chromatid exchange sce functional complementation uv cells liu cloned cdna termed xrcc confers resistance hygromycin mitomycin c xrcc contains prime gc rich untranslated region characteristic housekeeping genes putative amino acid protein leucine zipper motif n terminus authors found significant similarity known protein northern blot analysis kb xrcc mrna band present hela aa cells uv cells human baboon tissues major mrna bands kb detected highest levels testis thymus human testis baboon;-1

They subsequently isolated and sequenced the gene, which they called FGF6. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 70% identity with the HST gene product over the C-terminal two-thirds of the putative protein. FGF6 is the same as the HST2 oncogene, which was identified by its close homology to the HST1 gene.

Iida et al. (1992) determined that the HST2 gene encodes a 198-amino acid protein containing a signal peptide with the characteristics of a heparin-binding growth factor. RNA blot analysis detected expression of HST2 in human leukemia cell lines with platelet/megakaryocytic differentiation potential.
