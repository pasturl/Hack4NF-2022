Dean et al. (1985) showed that MET is in the tyrosine kinase family of oncogenes. It appeared to be most closely related in sequence to the human insulin receptor and ABL oncogene.

From the sequence of MET cDNA, Park et al. (1987) concluded that this oncogene is a cell-surface receptor for a then unknown ligand.

ATRX_DEL;0.0137500301566422;ATRX;"ATRX CHROMATIN REMODELER; ATRX";live;"Stayton et al. (1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al.

Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF.

The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

These receptors have strong sequence similarities to the products of the third class but possess only 3 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and a short kinase insert in the intracellular domain. By screening human and mouse testis cDNA libraries with an FMS probe, Rosnet et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNAs encoding human and mouse FLT3, a novel member of the class 3 receptors. FLT3 belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and has strong sequence similarities with other members of the group.

Lymphohematopoietic stem cells serve as a reservoir for virtually all blood cells but make up only approximately 0.01% of human or murine marrow cells. The ability to isolate and expand this population has clinical applications in bone marrow transplantations for cancer and genetic diseases. Small et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA for FLT3, which they called STK1, from a CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell-enriched library. The cDNA encodes a protein of 993 amino acids with 85% identity to the murine homolog.

The predicted 467-amino acid polypeptide, which the authors called JV18-1, shows maximal homology to Mad genes at the amino and carboxy termini of the protein, with 62% identity to Mad over 373 amino acids. Drosophila Mad apparently acts downstream of the TGF-beta receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/190181"">190181</a>) to transduce signals from the members of the TGF-beta gene family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/190180"">190180</a>).

Graff et al. (1996) described a family of Xenopus proteins homologous to the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans CEM genes. MAD and MAD-related proteins are important components of the serine/threonine kinase receptor signal transduction pathways. Eppert et al.

MADR2 shares high homology with MADR1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601595"">601595</a>) and significant homology with DPC4. They reported that MADR2 is rapidly phosphorylated by activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.

E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is effected by 3 cytoplasmic proteins known as catenins alpha, beta (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/116806"">116806</a>), and gamma. These catenins are thought to work as connectors that anchor the E-cadherin to the cytoskeletal actin bundle through the cadherin cytoplasmic domain. Dysfunction of this adhesion complex causes dissociation of cancer cells from primary tumor nodules, thus possibly contributing to cancer invasion and metastasis. Herrenknecht et al. (1991) and Nagafuchi et al. (1991) isolated a murine cDNA encoding the 102-kD alpha-catenin (CAP102). Oda et al. (1993) cloned and sequenced human alpha-catenin. They found that it shows extensive homology with that of the mouse. Hirano et al. (1992) and Shimoyama et al. (1992) showed that a human lung cancer cell line, PC9, which expresses E-cadherin but only a small quantity of abnormal-sized alpha-catenin, grew initially as isolated cells and then regained its cell-cell adhesion potential when transfected with alpha-catenin. Oda et al. (1993) found 2 abnormal mRNA sequences of alpha-catenin in PC9; one was a 957-bp deletion resulting in a 319-amino acid deletion and another was a 761-bp deletion resulting in a frameshift. The deletions were thought to be responsible for the loss of alpha-catenin expression.

Nakamura et al. (1992) cloned transcripts from the chromosome 17 portion of TRE from a cDNA library of cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA from TRE-transfected NIH 3T3 tumor cells. They obtained a novel cDNA, the 5-prime part of which overlapped the TRE transcript, and named its locus of origin TRE2. The complete cDNA spans 8,201 bp and possesses an unusually long noncoding region and a translatable region with 2 open reading frames (ORF). In 1 cDNA clone, the presence of 2 insertion sequences suggested the possibility of alternative splicing. Transfection-tumorigenicity assays with the ORFs subcloned into expression vectors were positive for the ORF adjacent to the 5-prime noncoding region and negative for the second, downstream ORF. Analysis of the 786-amino acid sequence deduced from the 5-prime ORF predicted a highly hydrophilic protein with 2 charge clusters suggesting nucleic acid-binding properties. When used as a probe, the cloned sequence detected RNA transcripts in a wide variety of human cancer cells regardless of their lineage of origin from different tissues, but not in human cells from normal tissue.

Gene duplication and domain accretion are thought to be the major mechanism for the emergence of novel genes during evolution. Genomic sequence analysis has demonstrated extensive amplification events during the evolution of higher primates. Paulding et al. (2003) reported that the USP6 oncogene is derived from the chimeric fusion of 2 genes, USP32 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607740"">607740</a>) and TBC1D3 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607741"">607741</a>). USP32 is an ancient highly conserved gene, whereas TBC1D3 is derived from a recent segmental duplication that is absent in most other mammals and shows rapid amplification and dispersal through the primate lineage. The chimeric gene USP6 exists only in the hominoid lineage of primates and arose as recently as 21 to 33 million years ago, after proliferation of the TBC1D3 segmental duplication in the primate lineage. Paulding et al. (2003) determined that the full-length USP6 gene encodes a 1,406-amino acid protein. Amino acids 1 to 496 are derived from TBC1D3 and encompass a TBC domain. Amino acids 501 to 1406 are derived from USP32 and encompass a ubiquitin-specific protease domain. In contrast to the broad expression patterns of USP32 and TBC1D3, RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of USP6 is testis-specific, a pattern proposed for genes implicated in the emergence of reproductive barriers. The authors concluded that the sudden emergence of chimeric proteins, such as that encoded by USP6, may have contributed to hominoid speciation.";tre locus first isolated nih cells transfected human ewing sarcoma dna nakamura huebner found locus discontinuous human cells composed major genetic elements originating prime prime human chromosomes nakamura cloned transcripts chromosome portion tre cdna library cytoplasmic poly rna tre transfected nih tumor cells obtained novel cdna prime part overlapped tre transcript named locus origin tre complete cdna spans bp possesses unusually long noncoding region translatable region open reading frames orf cdna clone presence insertion sequences suggested possibility alternative splicing transfection tumorigenicity assays orfs subcloned expression vectors positive orf adjacent prime noncoding region negative second downstream orf analysis amino acid sequence deduced prime orf predicted highly hydrophilic protein charge clusters suggesting nucleic acid binding properties used probe cloned sequence detected rna transcripts wide variety human cancer cells regardless lineage origin different tissues human cells normal tissue gene duplication domain accretion thought major mechanism emergence novel genes evolution genomic sequence analysis demonstrated extensive amplification events evolution higher primates paulding reported usp oncogene derived chimeric fusion genes usp entry tbc entry usp ancient highly conserved gene whereas tbc derived recent segmental duplication absent mammals shows rapid amplification dispersal primate lineage chimeric gene usp exists hominoid lineage primates arose recently million years ago proliferation tbc segmental duplication primate lineage paulding determined full length usp gene encodes amino acid protein amino acids derived tbc encompass tbc domain amino acids derived usp encompass ubiquitin specific protease domain contrast broad expression patterns usp tbc rt pcr analysis showed expression usp testis specific pattern proposed genes implicated emergence reproductive barriers authors concluded sudden emergence chimeric proteins encoded usp may contributed hominoid speciation;-1

The central core of each MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved cascade of 3 protein kinases: an activated MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates and activates a specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which then activates a specific MAPK. By functional complementation in yeast, Takekawa et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding MAP3K4, also called MEKK4, the human homolog of the S. cerevisiae Ssk2 and Ssk22 MAPKKKs. The 1,607-amino acid MEKK4 protein, called MTK1 by the authors, contains a protein kinase catalytic domain at the C terminus that is 98%, 42%, 36%, and 41% identical to the kinase domains of mouse MEKK4, Ssk2, Ssk22, and S. pombe Wik1, respectively.

This localization may occur by means of specific interactions between synaptic membrane proteins and a variety of anchoring or clustering molecules. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the intracellular C-terminal tail of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit (GRIN1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), Lin et al. (1998) isolated human brain cDNAs encoding a novel protein. The presumed full-length coding sequence encodes a predicted 1,642-amino acid protein containing many long coiled-coil regions throughout its length. Due to its coiled-coil structure, the authors named the protein 'yotiao,' after a popular Chinese breakfast food consisting of long strands of fried dough. The interaction of yotiao with NR1 is dependent upon the presence of the 37-amino acid region in the C-terminal tail of NR1 that is encoded by the alternatively spliced C1 exon cassette of NR1. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected an 11-kb yotiao transcript that was expressed abundantly in skeletal muscle and pancreas, to a lesser degree in heart and placenta, and modestly in brain. Immunohistochemical experiments indicated that yotiao is expressed in a somatodendritic pattern in neurons throughout the rat brain, with prominent expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The authors demonstrated that yotiao and NR1 are colocalized in rat brain. Yotiao is predominantly located at the neuromuscular junction in rat skeletal muscle. Biochemical studies showed that yotiao fractionates with cytoskeleton-associated proteins and with the postsynaptic density. Lin et al. (1998) concluded that yotiao is an NR1-binding protein that is potentially involved in the cytoskeletal attachment of NMDA receptors.

By overlay screening with RII (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/176910"">176910</a>), database searches, and PCR of a Jurkat T-lymphocyte expression library, Witczak et al. (1999) cloned AKAP9, which they designated AKAP450. The deduced 3,908-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 453 kD. The N-terminal 1,626 amino acids are identical to yotiao except for a 12-amino acid stretch not found in yotiao. The 2 proteins are alternatively spliced products of the AKAP9 gene. Northern blot analysis revealed a 12-kb transcript expressed in most tissues tested, with highest levels in kidney, intermediate levels in brain, heart, placenta, and lung, and low levels in skeletal muscle, liver, small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Prominent smearing suggested a high level of mRNA degradation. Hybridization with a more 3-prime probe revealed a transcript of about 8 kb that was prominently expressed in liver and kidney. Immunofluorescence localization showed staining of a single perinuclear dot in interphase HeLa cells and staining of 2 polarized dots in metaphase cells. Dual labeling of HeLa cells and Western blot analysis of purified centrosomes from a human lymphoblast cell line confirmed that AKAP9 localized to centrosomes. Western blot analysis revealed 4 distinct proteins in centrosome preparations, with the highest molecular mass protein migrating at about 450 kD.

Using the N-terminal region of protein kinase N (PKN; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601032"">601032</a>) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Takahashi et al. (1999) cloned a fragment of AKAP9, which they designated CGNAP. They obtained the full-length cDNA by screening neuroblastoma and HeLa cell cDNA libraries and by RACE of a hippocampus cDNA library. The deduced 3,899-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 452 kD. Takahashi et al. (1999) identified N- and C-terminal leucine zipper-like motifs and 2 central RII-binding motifs, as well as coiled-coil regions.

The translocation involves the TCR-delta locus (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186810"">186810</a>) on 14q11 and also a transcribed sequence on 11p15. They found that the gene on 11p15 is normally expressed in rhombomeres of the developing hindbrain. The gene product, designated rhombosine or rhombotin, has 155 amino acids and no homology to any previously described protein.

Because human and mouse rhombotin are virtually identical in derived protein sequence, rendering it difficult to identify functionally important regions or motifs, Boehm et al. (1990) isolated and compared rhombotin sequences from disparate species. They showed a sequence that is highly homologous to that of human and mouse rhombotin in Drosophila DNA. This comparison and others suggested that rhombotin, which lacks a DNA-binding homeodomain, may belong to a new class of transcriptional regulators that modulate transcription via intermolecular competitive binding to certain DNA-binding transcription factors. The structure of the predicted rhombotin protein suggests that it consists of 2 tandemly arranged cysteine-rich regions, which were subsequently identified in 3 transcription factors appended to putative DNA binding and activation domains, wherein they were termed LIM domains. The function of LIM domains may be in protein-protein interaction. LIM domains show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Consistent with its close structural homology to the human gene, the mouse homolog Ttg1 maps to chromosome 7, distal to the beta-globin locus (Angel et al., 1993).

Boehm et al. (1991) isolated 2 homologs of the rhombotin gene. Rhombotin-2 (RBTN2; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180385"">180385</a>) is located close to the T-ALL breakpoint cluster region on 11p13.

Homologs of this gene have been identified in several species, including mouse and human. Pittman et al. (1998) reported the identification of a novel member of the RAD51 gene family in both mouse and human. The mouse cDNA, Rad51d, isolated by screening EST databases with yeast RAD55 and human RAD51B amino acid sequences, encodes a predicted 329-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 35,260 Da. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of multiple transcripts of the Rad51d gene in all tissues examined. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from 7 mammalian species demonstrated that the RAD51D gene is conserved. Pittman et al. (1998) used the mouse nucleotide sequence to screen a human EST database and identified 2 RAD51D cDNA clones from human T-lymphocyte and placenta libraries; both cDNAs appeared to be variants of the mouse gene. The shorter cDNA represented an alternatively spliced product and excluded sequences corresponding to 2 exons in the mouse gene, one of which encodes the first ATP-binding motif. The longer cDNA skipped a single exon present in the mouse gene, resulting in a frameshift and a predicted truncated protein. The authors stated that if the frameshift is ignored, the full-length putative 289-amino acid protein shares 71% sequence identity with the predicted mouse protein, and the mouse and human RAD51D genes have 2 conserved ATP-binding domains similar to other RecA-related genes.

The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency.

Tsujimoto et al.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

They gene showed extensive homology to the BCL2 family of genes. The gene was expressed in normal brain as a 4.5-kb transcript and as a 1.8-kb transcript in human gliomas, which suggested to the authors that it may be rearranged in these tumors. The open reading frame of the BRAG1 gene encoded a protein of 31 kD. Using a bacterial expression vector, Das et al. (1996) produced BRAG1 protein that was found to crossreact with a BCL2 monoclonal antibody, further suggesting structural and immunologic similarity to BCL2.

It regulates gene expression and stimulates mitogenesis and appears to mediate insulin/IGF1-stimulated glucose transport. Thus, the finding that the homozygous Irs1 knockout mouse survives with only mild resistance to hypertension was surprising. This dilemma was provisionally resolved by the discovery by Sun et al. (1995) of a second IRS signaling protein in mouse. They purified and cloned a likely candidate from mouse myeloid progenitor cells and, because of its resemblance to IRS1, they designated it IRS2. Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

To identify genes whose transcription might be repressed during the genesis of neuroblastomas, Shtivelman and Bishop (1991) used subtractive cDNA cloning to detect genes expressed in human melanomas and pheochromocytomas but not in neuroblastomas. The first of these genes identified encoded the cell surface protein CD44 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/107269"">107269</a>), an integral membrane glycoprotein that is the principal receptor for hyaluronate on the cell surface. A second gene, originally designated PM227, attracted their attention because its expression appeared to be coordinated with that of CD44. Shtivelman et al. (1992) reported that PM227 encodes a protein whose exceptionally large size of 700 kD caused them to rename the gene AHNAK (meaning 'giant' in Hebrew). The amino acid sequence of AHNAK suggested secondary structure with a periodicity of 2.33 residues per turn. Individual chains could associate to form a 7- or 8-stranded barrel. The resulting structure would be a polyionic rod with length as great as 1.2 microns. Preliminary evidence indicated that the protein resides predominantly within the nucleus, but no function had been discerned.

Expressed exclusively in the olfactory receptor neurons and their precursors, the Olf1 protein contains a new helix-loop-helix motif and functions as an apparent homodimer. They suggested that Olf1 may be the first member of a family of related proteins that may direct cellular differentiation in a variety of neuronal tissues.

Early B-cell factor (EBF) is a tissue-specific and differentiation stage-specific DNA-binding protein that participates in the regulation of the pre-B and B lymphocyte-specific MB1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/112205"">112205</a>) gene. Travis et al. (1993) purified the mouse Ebf protein from pre-B cells and found that it is composed of two 62- to 65-kD subunits. Hagman et al. (1993) determined partial amino acid sequences of Ebf and used them to isolate mouse pre-B-cell cDNAs encoding Ebf. The predicted 591-amino acid protein has 2 functional domains: an N-terminal cysteine-rich region essential for DNA binding, and a C-terminal dimerization region containing two 15-amino acid repeats with similarity to the dimerization domains of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. The calculated molecular mass of the encoded Ebf protein is 64.4 kD. The authors found that recombinant Ebf binds to DNA as a homodimer, forms complexes with the Mb1 promoter, and is a strong activator of transcription. Northern blot analysis detected multiple Ebf transcripts in pre-B- and early B-cell lines but not in other hematopoietic cells. S1 nuclease protection analysis of adult mouse RNAs showed high levels of Ebf expression in lymph node, spleen, and adipose tissues and low levels in several nonlymphoid tissues.

Mice lacking Ebf are unable develop B lymphoid cells (Lin and Grosschedl, 1995). Using 5-prime RACE and primer extension analysis, Smith et al.

Identification of the gene came from study of a rat model in which the gene for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease mapped to rat chromosome 9 in a region of syntenic homology to a portion of the human chromosome 6 containing the locus for ARPKD. The PKHD1 open reading frame is 12,222 basepairs and encodes a protein of 4,074 amino acids. Ward et al. (2002) found that the PKHD1 transcript, approximately 16 kb long, is expressed at moderate levels in adult kidney and pancreas, with lower expression in liver. Moderate expression was also detected in fetal kidney. The large protein encoded by PKHD1 contains multiple copies of a domain, TIG, shared with plexins and transcription factors. It was thought that fibrocystin may be a receptor protein that acts in collecting duct and biliary differentiation.

Onuchic et al. (2002) identified several distinct PKHD1 transcripts containing unique combinations of exons. The transcript with the longest open reading frame encoded a deduced 4,074-amino acid integral membrane protein, which the authors designated polyductin. This protein has a 3,858-amino acid extracellular N terminus, a single transmembrane (TM) domain, and a short C terminus. The extracellular region contains 6 immunoglobulin-like plexin (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601055"">601055</a>)-transcription factor (IPT) domains, followed by at least 9 HbH1 repeats, which are commonly associated with polysaccharidases. It also has multiple potential N-glycosylation sites, an RGD domain, and 3 putative cAMP/cGMP phosphorylation sites. The other PKHD1 gene products were predicted to fall into 2 broad groups: those that encode proteins containing the TM element, which are likely to be associated with the plasma membrane, and those that encode proteins lacking the TM domain, which are likely to be secreted. Northern blot analysis detected a smear of transcripts from 8.5 to 13 kb, with highest expression in adult and fetal kidney. Adult kidney showed strong diffuse bands of about 9.0 and 12.0 kb, and fetal kidney showed smaller and more uniformly sizes transcripts.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 as bait, Hu et al. (1994) isolated B-cell cDNAs encoding a protein that they called CD40-binding protein (CD40bp). The predicted CD40bp protein contains a RING finger DNA-binding motif, a cys/his-rich region, and a coiled-coil domain. Like TRAF1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601711"">601711</a>) and TRAF2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601895"">601895</a>), both TNFR2 (75-kD TNFR; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/191191"">191191</a>)-binding proteins, CD40bp contains a C-terminal TRAF domain. In vitro translated CD40bp has an apparent molecular mass of 64 kD. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that CD40bp interacts with CD40 in human B cells. Hu et al. (1994) suggested that CD40bp, along with TRAF1 and TRAF2, comprise a family of proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic faces of the TNFR family and have in common a TRAF domain.

Independently, Sato et al. (1995) and Cheng et al. (1995) identified CD40bp, designating it CAP1 (CD40-associated protein-1) and CRAF1 (CD40 receptor-associated factor 1), respectively. Sato et al. (1995) demonstrated that CAP1 binds specifically to the cytoplasmic domain of CD40, but not to that of TNFR1, TNFR2, or FAS. The C-terminal TRAF domain of CAP1 was sufficient to mediate binding to CD40 and homodimerization. Cheng et al. (1995) isolated mouse and human CRAF1 cDNAs. The predicted 568-amino acid human protein is 96% identical to mouse CRAF1. These authors divided the TRAF domain into 2 regions: TRAF-N, the more N-terminal coiled-coil subdomain, and TRAF-C, which was necessary and sufficient for CRAF1 to interact with CD40. Overexpression of a truncated cDNA encoding the entire TRAF domain of CRAF1 inhibited CD40-mediated upregulation of the CD23 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151445"">151445</a>) gene, which suggested to Cheng et al.

PKs can be grouped based on sequence similarities and on specificity for the acceptor amino acid. Most PKs phosphorylate either serine/threonine or tyrosine. Some PKs, referred to as mixed-lineage kinases (e.g., MAP3K9; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600136"">600136</a>), have features of both serine/threonine and tyrosine PKs. All PKs have Src homology (SH) domains (see MAP3K11; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600050"">600050</a>). PKs can also be grouped as receptors or nonreceptors. Receptor PKs have a transmembrane region, an extracellular ligand-binding domain, and an intracellular catalytic domain.

By screening a human cerebellum cDNA library with a rat brain cDNA of unknown function, Sakuma et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel PK, MAP3K13, which they called LZK (leucine zipper-bearing kinase). Sequence analysis showed that the deduced 966-amino acid MAP3K13 protein has no apparent signal sequence or transmembrane region but does contain a kinase catalytic domain, a double leucine/isoleucine zipper, and an acidic domain at its C-terminal end. The MAP3K13 catalytic domain has features of both serine/threonine PKs and tyrosine PKs. MAP3K13 shares 86.4% amino acid identity with MAP3K12 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600447"">600447</a>), a mixed-lineage kinase. Northern blot analysis detected 9.5-, 8.7-, and 6.5-kb MAP3K13 transcripts most strongly in pancreas. These transcripts were also expressed strongly in brain, liver, and placenta, but no expression was detected in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that MAP3K13 is expressed as a 135- to 150-kD protein that is associated with membrane components.

A critical protein kinase lies upstream of MAP kinase and stimulates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinase. Crews et al. (1992) cloned a mouse cDNA, denoted Mek1 (for Map/Erk kinase-1) by them, that encodes a member of this protein kinase family. The 393-amino acid, 43.5-kD protein is most closely related in size and sequence to the product encoded by the byr1 gene of S. pombe. The Mek1 gene was highly expressed in murine brain.

(1993) cloned human DDR1, which they called DDR. The predicted protein contains 913 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 105 kD. It has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions. The extracellular region contains a discoidin I-like domain, a pro/gly-rich region, 4 putative N-glycosylation sites, and 7 cysteines. The cytoplasmic domain contains a pro/gly-rich region and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.0-kb transcript in multiple human cell lines, with highest expression in breast carcinoma cell lines and an epidermoid carcinoma cell line. Expression was also detected in several mouse tissues, with highest levels in kidney, spleen, and placenta. Immunoblot analysis revealed a 120-kD DDR protein in transfected COS-7 cells. The DDR protein was detected in human breast carcinoma cell lines, but not in a variety of other human cell lines.

Using PCR to identify protein tyrosine kinases in HeLa cells, Perez et al. (1994) obtained a cDNA encoding DDR1, which they they called CAK. The deduced 913-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 101 kD. It has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic receptor tyrosine kinase domain. The N-terminal extracellular domain shares similarity with phospholipid-binding sequences found in cell adhesion molecules, such as neuronal A5 antigen and factors V (F5; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/612309"">612309</a>) and VIII (F8; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300841"">300841</a>), and it has 7 cysteines, 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, and a furin (FUR; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/136950"">136950</a>) cleavage site (RxRR). The C-terminal kinase domain contains motifs characteristic of a receptor tyrosine kinase, including a canonical GxGxxG sequence of the ATP-binding loop and 4 tyrosine phosphorylation sites, 3 of which may be autophosphorylated. Northern blot analysis detected a 5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in brain and lung. CAK expression was also detected in mouse brain and in several human cell lines.

By screening a keratinocyte cDNA library with the catalytic domain of TRKA (NTRK1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/191315"">191315</a>), followed by screening fetal brain and keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Di Marco et al. (1993) cloned a splice variant of DDR1 that they designated TRKE. The deduced 876-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by an extracellular domain with 5 consensus N-glycosylation sites and 7 cysteines, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with a kinase catalytic domain that includes an ATP-binding site and a putative autophosphorylation site. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.9-kb TRKE transcript in human keratinocytes and in all adult and fetal human tissues examined except liver.

Using PCR, Laval et al. (1994) cloned a splice variant of DDR1 that they called RTK6 from a human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line. The deduced 876-amino acid protein, which is identical to TRKE (Di Marco et al., 1993), has a calculated molecular mass of 97 kD. Compared with the DDR protein (Johnson et al., 1993), RTK6 lacks 37 amino acids between the transmembrane region and the catalytic domain. Northern blot analysis detected high expression of a 4.5-kb RTK6 transcript in brain, with lower expression in heart, placenta, lung, liver, muscle, kidney, and pancreas. RT-PCR detected expression of both DDR and RTK6 in placenta and in all ovarian cell lines tested. In situ hybridization detected RTK6 in epithelial cells of human ovary, small intestine, thymus, fetal lung, fetal kidney, and gray matter of fetal brain. RTK6 was expressed at high levels in moderately and poorly differentiated malignant ovarian tumors and at lower levels in normal, benign, and borderline tumors. Western blot analysis detected RTK6 at an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD, suggesting that the fully processed, mature protein is glycosylated.

Playford et al. (1996) identified 2 splice variants of DDR1, which they called EDDR1 and EDDR2. EDDR1 lacks exon 11 and corresponds to TRKE/RTK6 (Di Marco et al., 1993; Laval et al., 1994). EDDR2 uses a cryptic splice site in the 5-prime region of exon 14, resulting in an in-frame addition of 6 amino acids in the catalytic domain compared with DDR.

Edelhoff et al. (1995) noted that DDR1 shares 93% amino acid identity with its putative mouse homolog, Nep, also called Ptk3. Nep is widely expressed in fetal and adult mouse tissues.

Each complex spans about 200 kb and contains 9 to 11 genes, transcribed from the same strand of DNA. The order of the HOX genes along the chromosome correlates with their expression along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo, suggesting that their organization is integral to their proper regulation. Members of the abdominal B (AbdB) subfamily of HOX genes exhibit posterior domains of expression, including the developing urogenital system, in vertebrates. It was thought that HOXB genes 10 through 13 had been lost in evolution. Using Southwestern screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zeltser et al. (1996) identified HOXB13, a novel member of the AbdB subfamily. Analysis of the cDNA revealed that the HOXB13 gene encodes a 284-amino acid protein, 2 residues shorter than the mouse protein, which was also characterized by Zeltser et al. (1996). The 60-amino acid homeodomain near the C terminus of HOXB13 shares 78 to 83% identity with HOX proteins in paralog group-13 of the AbdB subfamily; 6 of the amino acid differences from other members of this group represent conservative changes. Moreover, HOXB13 shares less than 60% identity with other AbdB-related genes. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, Zeltser et al.

Type 1 transporters, such as NPT1 (SLC17A1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/182308"">182308</a>), are found mainly in kidney and do not appear to be regulated by dietary phosphate levels. Type 2 transporters can be subdivided into 2 groups based on sequence similarity and tissue distribution.

Suzuki et al. (1996) described the molecular cloning, chromosomal location, and the transcription of the human GATA6 gene. The cDNA encodes a predicted 449-amino acid protein that is highly conserved among vertebrates and includes 2 adjacent zinc finger/basic domains characteristic of the GATA factor family. The gene is transcribed in a pattern overlapping that of GATA4 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600576"">600576</a>). Transcripts for both of these genes are prominent in heart, pancreas, and ovary, but only GATA6 mRNA was found in lung and liver. GATA6 transcripts were also detected in cultures of human and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. In these cells, GATA6 transcripts were downregulated when quiescent cultures were stimulated to proliferate in response to mitogen activation. The results demonstrate that GATA6 is subject to both tissue-specific and mitogen-responsive regulatory signals. Suzuki et al. (1996) commented that GATA6 is a prime candidate for a gene that regulates the differentiative state of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Maitra et al.

RT-PCR experiments yielded in-frame MORF-CBP and CBP-MORF fusion transcripts. Genomic analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron 16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near the breakpoints. The authors constructed an exon/intron map of the MORF gene. The MORF-CBP protein retained the zinc fingers, 2 nuclear localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, a portion of the acidic domain of MORF, and the CBP protein downstream of codon 29.
