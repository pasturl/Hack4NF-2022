In addition, p53 appears to induce apoptosis through nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes. In unstressed cells, p53 is kept inactive essentially through the actions of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164785"">164785</a>), which inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and ubiquitinates p53 to promote its degradation. Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity. Activity of p53 is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by mutation of the p53 gene itself or by loss of cell signaling upstream or downstream of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Bourdon, 2007; Vousden and Lane, 2007).";transcription factor p responds diverse cellular stresses regulate target genes induce cell cycle arrest apoptosis senescence dna repair changes metabolism addition p appears induce apoptosis nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes unstressed cells p kept inactive essentially actions ubiquitin ligase mdm entry inhibits p transcriptional activity ubiquitinates p promote degradation numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p activity notably phosphorylation acetylation several less abundant p isoforms also modulate p activity activity p ubiquitously lost human cancer either mutation p gene loss cell signaling upstream downstream p toledo wahl bourdon vousden lane;-1

The RAS proteins are GDP/GTP-binding proteins that act as intracellular signal transducers. The most well-studied members of the RAS (derived from 'RAt Sarcoma' virus) gene family include KRAS, HRAS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/190020"">190020</a>), and NRAS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164790"">164790</a>). These genes encode immunologically related proteins with a molecular mass of 21 kD and are homologs of rodent sarcoma virus genes that have transforming abilities. While these wildtype cellular proteins in humans play a vital role in normal tissue signaling, including proliferation, differentiation, and senescence, mutated genes are potent oncogenes that play a role in many human cancers (Weinberg, 1982; Kranenburg, 2005).";kras gene encodes human cellular homolog transforming gene isolated kirsten rat sarcoma virus ras proteins gdp gtp binding proteins act intracellular signal transducers well studied members ras derived rat sarcoma virus gene family include kras hras entry nras entry genes encode immunologically related proteins molecular mass kd homologs rodent sarcoma virus genes transforming abilities wildtype cellular proteins humans play vital role normal tissue signaling including proliferation differentiation senescence mutated genes potent oncogenes play role many human cancers weinberg kranenburg;-1

Using the ALL1 SET domain as a probe, Prasad et al. (1997) cloned a novel gene, KMT2D, which they designated ALR (ALL1-related gene). The gene encodes a 5,262-amino acid protein containing a SET domain, 5 PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a long run of glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues (mostly leucine). They also detected an alternatively spliced form encoding 4,957 amino acids and lacking an N-terminal zinc finger and PHD finger. Analysis of ALR expression showed that its approximately 18-kb transcript is expressed, like ALL1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic cells, but not in liver. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of early mouse embryos indicated expression of a similar mouse gene in multiple tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern, Prasad et al.

Small amounts of these terminal sequences are lost from the tips of the chromosomes each S phase because of incomplete DNA replication, but de novo addition of TTAGGG repeats by the enzyme telomerase compensates for this loss. Many human cells progressively lose terminal sequence with cell division, a loss that correlates with the apparent absence of telomerase in these cells (Kipling, 1995).;human telomeres consist many kilobases ttaggg n together various associated proteins small amounts terminal sequences lost tips chromosomes phase incomplete dna replication de novo addition ttaggg repeats enzyme telomerase compensates loss many human cells progressively lose terminal sequence cell division loss correlates apparent absence telomerase cells kipling;-1
PDGFRA_SNP;0.0010919976142268;PDGFRA;"PLATELET-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR, ALPHA; PDGFRA";live;"Matsui et al. (1989) identified a genomic sequence and a cloned cDNA for a novel receptor-like gene of the PDGF receptor/CSF1 receptor family. The gene recognized a 6.4-kb transcript that was coexpressed in normal human tissues with the 5.3-kb PDGF receptor mRNA. The characteristics of the new receptor were different from the previously known one (PDGFR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>). Matsui et al. (1989) suggested that the existence of genes encoding 2 PDGF receptors that interact in a distinct manner with 3 different PDGF isoforms may confer regulatory flexibility in functional responses to PDGF.

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al. (2003) demonstrated that idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607685"">607685</a>) is often caused by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in fusion of PDGFRA and FIP1L1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607686"">607686</a>), a neighboring gene. The PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that transforms hematopoietic cells and is a therapeutic target of imatinib. Cools et al. (2003) identified the PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene in 9 of 16 patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and in 5 of 9 patients with responses to imatinib that lasted more than 3 months. Relapse in one patient correlated with the appearance of a thr674-to-ile mutation in the PDGFRA gene (T674I; {173490.0008}) that conferred resistance to imatinib.";matsui identified genomic sequence cloned cdna novel receptor like gene pdgf receptor csf receptor family gene recognized kb transcript coexpressed normal human tissues kb pdgf receptor mrna characteristics new receptor different previously known one pdgfr entry matsui suggested existence genes encoding pdgf receptors interact distinct manner different pdgf isoforms may confer regulatory flexibility functional responses pdgf subhead pdgfra fusion genes chronic myeloid leukemia cml entry characterized presence bcr entry abl entry fusion gene usually association q q chromosomal translocation baxter reported identification cloning rare variant translocation q q patients cml like myeloproliferative disease unusual frame bcr pdgfra fusion mrna identified patients either bcr exon exon fused short bcr intron derived sequences turn fused part pdgfra exon sequencing genomic breakpoint junctions showed chromosome breakpoints fell bcr introns whereas chromosome breakpoints within pdgfra exon cools demonstrated idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome entry often caused interstitial deletion chromosome q resulting fusion pdgfra fip l entry neighboring gene pdgfra fip l gene constitutively activated tyrosine kinase transforms hematopoietic cells therapeutic target imatinib cools identified pdgfra fip l gene patients idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome patients responses imatinib lasted months relapse one patient correlated appearance thr ile mutation pdgfra gene conferred resistance imatinib;-1
