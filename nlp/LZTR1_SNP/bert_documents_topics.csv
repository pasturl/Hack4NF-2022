Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein. CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

It appears likely that the reaction catalyzed by topoisomerase II involves the crossing-over of 2 DNA segments. Miller et al.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al. (2009) identified 2 additional short isoforms of HGF including exons 1 to 4 and a 3-prime untranslated region transcribed from intron 4.";plasma patients fulminant hepatic failure contains factor stimulates growth adult rat hepatocytes primary culture gohda purified hgf patient plasma showed multiple forms molecular mass kd hgf consists chains heavy light molecular mass kd kd respectively chains linked together disulfide bonds miyazawa nakamura sequenced cdnas encoding hgf deduced sequence pre pro protein consisted amino acid residues sequence showed heavy light chains encoded mrna produced common translation product proteolytic processing difference deduced number amino acid residues probably indicates hgf distinct hepatocyte stimulatory factor hsf interferon beta entry rubin studied mitogen derived lung fibroblasts identical hgf closely related showed human lung fibroblast derived mitogen spectrum targets including endothelial cells melanocytes addition epithelial cells gherardi stoker found hgf structurally similar identical scatter factor molecule shown stimulate dissociation scattering epithelial cells sequence hgf identity plasminogen entry putative cleavage site hgf identical plasminogen potent mitogen hepatocytes hgf also known hepatopoietin hbga szpirer weidner presented structural functional evidence human scatter factor sf human hgf identical proteins encoded single gene lung fibroblast derived mitogen also coded gene hgf cellular receptor gene met oncogene entry located q hgf gene thus cells polysomy chromosome may simultaneously overproduce factor receptor acquire invasive properties autocrine mechanism increase copy number chromosome one common chromosome abnormalities observed human malignant gliomas entry schultz determined hgf shares identity mouse homolog authors stated multiple isoforms hgf hgf isoform encodes preprotein cleaved alpha beta chains alpha chain composed hairpin loop follow n terminal kringle domains beta chain homology trypsin like serine proteases catalytic function hgf isoform encodes kringle domains hgf isoform isoform similar respectively differing use alternate exon b splice acceptor site isoform encodes kringle domain utilizes exon acceptor site schultz identified additional short isoforms hgf including exons prime untranslated region transcribed intron;-1

An approximately 4-kb SNCAIP transcript was detected in many human tissues by Northern blot analysis and was particularly enriched in brain, heart, and placenta. Synphilin-1 was present in many regions in brain, including substantia nigra.

Alternative splicing resulted in 2 distinct BCLX mRNAs. The protein product of the larger mRNA (BCLXL) was similar in size and predicted structure to BCL2. When stably transfected into an IL3-dependent cell line, it inhibited cell death upon growth factor withdrawal at least as well as BCL2. Unexpectedly, the smaller mRNA species (BCLXS) encodes a protein that inhibits the ability of BCL2 to enhance the survival of growth factor-deprived cells. In vivo, the smaller BCLX mRNA was expressed at high levels in cells that undergo a high rate of turnover, such as developing lymphocytes. In contrast, the large form of BCLX was found in tissues containing long-lived postmitotic cells, such as adult brain. Together these data suggested that BCLX plays an important role in both positive and negative regulation of programmed cell death. Boise et al.

Helios, an Ikaros-related zinc finger protein, has been identified in mouse. By screening a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Helios cDNA probe, Hosokawa et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding human HELIOS, or IKZF2. The predicted 526-amino acid human protein is 97% identical to the mouse protein and contains 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, which compose the DNA-binding domain, and 2 C-terminal zinc fingers, which mediate protein dimerization. RT-PCR and sequence analyses indicated that, as in mouse, a 502-residue IKZF2 isoform that lacks the first N-terminal zinc finger exists in humans.

HOXB13_SNP;0.0010210153337583;HOXB13;"HOMEOBOX B13; HOXB13";live;"Vertebrate HOX genes are clustered in 4 unlinked complexes in the genome (HOXA, HOXB, HOXC, and HOXD clusters). Each complex spans about 200 kb and contains 9 to 11 genes, transcribed from the same strand of DNA. The order of the HOX genes along the chromosome correlates with their expression along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo, suggesting that their organization is integral to their proper regulation. Members of the abdominal B (AbdB) subfamily of HOX genes exhibit posterior domains of expression, including the developing urogenital system, in vertebrates. It was thought that HOXB genes 10 through 13 had been lost in evolution. Using Southwestern screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zeltser et al. (1996) identified HOXB13, a novel member of the AbdB subfamily. Analysis of the cDNA revealed that the HOXB13 gene encodes a 284-amino acid protein, 2 residues shorter than the mouse protein, which was also characterized by Zeltser et al. (1996). The 60-amino acid homeodomain near the C terminus of HOXB13 shares 78 to 83% identity with HOX proteins in paralog group-13 of the AbdB subfamily; 6 of the amino acid differences from other members of this group represent conservative changes. Moreover, HOXB13 shares less than 60% identity with other AbdB-related genes. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, Zeltser et al. (1996) determined that Hoxb13 was expressed first in the tailbud of embryonic mice and subsequently in the hindgut, urogenital tract, and posterior extent of the spinal cord. It was not expressed in the secondary axes.

During the first 2 trimesters of development, wound healing occurs without scars. Using RT-PCR and sequencing of human fetal fibroblast mRNA, Stelnicki et al. (1998) identified 2 homeobox genes, PRX2 and HOXB13, as being differentially expressed during fetal versus adult wound healing. Both genes were expressed in proliferating fibroblasts and fetal dermis, but not in adult dermis. The protein sequence of HOXB13 differed from that reported by Zeltser et al.

(1993) identified a member of a new family of protein kinases. The catalytic domain of these kinases had amino acid sequence similarity to both the tyr-specific and the ser/thr-specific kinase classes. Dorow et al. (1993) isolated clones representing 2 members of this new family from a human colonic epithelial cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence revealed that, in addition to their unusual nature of the kinase catalytic domains, they contain 2 leu/ile-zipper motifs and a basic sequence near their C-termini. Because they possess domains associated with proteins from 2 distinct functional groups, these kinases were referred to as mixed-lineage kinases (MLK) 1 and 2. MLK1 mRNA was found to be expressed in epithelial tumor cell lines of colonic, breast, and esophageal origin.

USP6_SNP;0.0010022070536807;USP6;"UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 6; USP6";live;"The TRE locus was first isolated from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with human Ewing sarcoma DNA (Nakamura et al., 1988). Huebner et al. (1988) found that the locus is discontinuous in human cells and is composed of 3 major genetic elements originating 5-prime to 3-prime from human chromosomes 5, 18, and 17. Nakamura et al. (1992) cloned transcripts from the chromosome 17 portion of TRE from a cDNA library of cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA from TRE-transfected NIH 3T3 tumor cells. They obtained a novel cDNA, the 5-prime part of which overlapped the TRE transcript, and named its locus of origin TRE2. The complete cDNA spans 8,201 bp and possesses an unusually long noncoding region and a translatable region with 2 open reading frames (ORF). In 1 cDNA clone, the presence of 2 insertion sequences suggested the possibility of alternative splicing. Transfection-tumorigenicity assays with the ORFs subcloned into expression vectors were positive for the ORF adjacent to the 5-prime noncoding region and negative for the second, downstream ORF. Analysis of the 786-amino acid sequence deduced from the 5-prime ORF predicted a highly hydrophilic protein with 2 charge clusters suggesting nucleic acid-binding properties. When used as a probe, the cloned sequence detected RNA transcripts in a wide variety of human cancer cells regardless of their lineage of origin from different tissues, but not in human cells from normal tissue.

Gene duplication and domain accretion are thought to be the major mechanism for the emergence of novel genes during evolution. Genomic sequence analysis has demonstrated extensive amplification events during the evolution of higher primates. Paulding et al. (2003) reported that the USP6 oncogene is derived from the chimeric fusion of 2 genes, USP32 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607740"">607740</a>) and TBC1D3 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607741"">607741</a>). USP32 is an ancient highly conserved gene, whereas TBC1D3 is derived from a recent segmental duplication that is absent in most other mammals and shows rapid amplification and dispersal through the primate lineage. The chimeric gene USP6 exists only in the hominoid lineage of primates and arose as recently as 21 to 33 million years ago, after proliferation of the TBC1D3 segmental duplication in the primate lineage. Paulding et al. (2003) determined that the full-length USP6 gene encodes a 1,406-amino acid protein. Amino acids 1 to 496 are derived from TBC1D3 and encompass a TBC domain. Amino acids 501 to 1406 are derived from USP32 and encompass a ubiquitin-specific protease domain. In contrast to the broad expression patterns of USP32 and TBC1D3, RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of USP6 is testis-specific, a pattern proposed for genes implicated in the emergence of reproductive barriers. The authors concluded that the sudden emergence of chimeric proteins, such as that encoded by USP6, may have contributed to hominoid speciation.";tre locus first isolated nih cells transfected human ewing sarcoma dna nakamura huebner found locus discontinuous human cells composed major genetic elements originating prime prime human chromosomes nakamura cloned transcripts chromosome portion tre cdna library cytoplasmic poly rna tre transfected nih tumor cells obtained novel cdna prime part overlapped tre transcript named locus origin tre complete cdna spans bp possesses unusually long noncoding region translatable region open reading frames orf cdna clone presence insertion sequences suggested possibility alternative splicing transfection tumorigenicity assays orfs subcloned expression vectors positive orf adjacent prime noncoding region negative second downstream orf analysis amino acid sequence deduced prime orf predicted highly hydrophilic protein charge clusters suggesting nucleic acid binding properties used probe cloned sequence detected rna transcripts wide variety human cancer cells regardless lineage origin different tissues human cells normal tissue gene duplication domain accretion thought major mechanism emergence novel genes evolution genomic sequence analysis demonstrated extensive amplification events evolution higher primates paulding reported usp oncogene derived chimeric fusion genes usp entry tbc entry usp ancient highly conserved gene whereas tbc derived recent segmental duplication absent mammals shows rapid amplification dispersal primate lineage chimeric gene usp exists hominoid lineage primates arose recently million years ago proliferation tbc segmental duplication primate lineage paulding determined full length usp gene encodes amino acid protein amino acids derived tbc encompass tbc domain amino acids derived usp encompass ubiquitin specific protease domain contrast broad expression patterns usp tbc rt pcr analysis showed expression usp testis specific pattern proposed genes implicated emergence reproductive barriers authors concluded sudden emergence chimeric proteins encoded usp may contributed hominoid speciation;2
