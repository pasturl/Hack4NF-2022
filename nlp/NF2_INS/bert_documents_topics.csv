In unstressed cells, p53 is kept inactive essentially through the actions of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164785"">164785</a>), which inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and ubiquitinates p53 to promote its degradation. Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity.

CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions.

The SET domain is a highly conserved, approximately 150-amino acid motif implicated in the modulation of chromatin structure. It was originally identified as part of a larger conserved region present in the Drosophila Trithorax protein and was subsequently identified in the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and 'Enhancer of zeste' proteins, from which the acronym SET is derived. Studies have suggested that the SET domain may be a signature of proteins that modulate transcriptionally active or repressed chromatin states through chromatin remodeling activities. In the course of searching sequence databases for proteins containing SET domains, Harte et al. (1999) identified the SETDB1 sequence. They determined that SETDB1 has a C-terminal SET domain that is well-conserved except that it contains a 347-amino acid insertion between its most highly conserved regions.

It regulates gene expression and stimulates mitogenesis and appears to mediate insulin/IGF1-stimulated glucose transport. Thus, the finding that the homozygous Irs1 knockout mouse survives with only mild resistance to hypertension was surprising. This dilemma was provisionally resolved by the discovery by Sun et al. (1995) of a second IRS signaling protein in mouse. They purified and cloned a likely candidate from mouse myeloid progenitor cells and, because of its resemblance to IRS1, they designated it IRS2. Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

Ogihara et al. (1997) screened a human genomic library with a mouse Irs2 cDNA. They isolated a cDNA encoding a full-length human IRS2 protein. Using immunoprecipitation studies, Ogihara et al. (1997) showed that recombinant IRS2 protein expressed in a baculovirus system can form a complex with 14-3-3 protein (YWHA).

Wong-Staal et al. (1981) identified human DNA sequences homologous to cloned DNA fragments containing the oncogenic nucleic acid sequences of a type C mammalian retrovirus, the Harvey strain of murine sarcoma virus (HaMSV) derived from the rat. Non-onc intervening sequences were present in the human counterpart, which is rather highly conserved in mammalian evolution and probably plays a role in normal cell growth or differentiation. Allelic variation in the human onc HaMSV gene was identified. The transforming genes of retroviruses are derived from a group of cellular genes that are highly conserved evolutionarily. The relationship between viral transforming genes (collectively called v-onc) and their normal cellular counterparts (collectively called c-onc) is obviously of great scientific and medical interest. Chang et al. (1982) studied the Harvey and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses, 2 closely related rat-derived transforming retroviruses called v-Ha-ras and v-Ki-ras, respectively. They concluded that the human genome contains several copies of the c-ras gene family and that c-Ha-ras-1 (with intervening sequences) (HRAS1) has been more highly conserved than has c-Ha-ras-2 (HRAS2; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300437"">300437</a>).";ras oncogenes hras kras entry nras entry encode kd proteins called p wong staal identified human dna sequences homologous cloned dna fragments containing oncogenic nucleic acid sequences type c mammalian retrovirus harvey strain murine sarcoma virus hamsv derived rat non onc intervening sequences present human counterpart rather highly conserved mammalian evolution probably plays role normal cell growth differentiation allelic variation human onc hamsv gene identified transforming genes retroviruses derived group cellular genes highly conserved evolutionarily relationship viral transforming genes collectively called v onc normal cellular counterparts collectively called c onc obviously great scientific medical interest chang studied harvey kirsten murine sarcoma viruses closely related rat derived transforming retroviruses called v ha ras v ki ras respectively concluded human genome contains several copies c ras gene family c ha ras intervening sequences hras highly conserved c ha ras hras entry;0
