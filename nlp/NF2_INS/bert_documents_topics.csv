Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity.

The RQC domain contains a 144-amino acid DNA- and protein-binding domain (DPBD) that also functions as a nucleolar targeting sequence. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Hu et al.

(1994) isolated a cDNA encoding SETDB1, which they called KIAA0067. The deduced SETDB1 protein has 1,291 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected SETDB1 expression in all 16 human tissues examined.

The SET domain is a highly conserved, approximately 150-amino acid motif implicated in the modulation of chromatin structure. It was originally identified as part of a larger conserved region present in the Drosophila Trithorax protein and was subsequently identified in the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and 'Enhancer of zeste' proteins, from which the acronym SET is derived. Studies have suggested that the SET domain may be a signature of proteins that modulate transcriptionally active or repressed chromatin states through chromatin remodeling activities. In the course of searching sequence databases for proteins containing SET domains, Harte et al. (1999) identified the SETDB1 sequence. They determined that SETDB1 has a C-terminal SET domain that is well-conserved except that it contains a 347-amino acid insertion between its most highly conserved regions. The authors found that the C. elegans YNCA gene product is highly similar to SETDB1 and also contains a bifurcated SET domain.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

Di Iorio et al. (2005) stated that the p63 gene generates 6 isoforms. The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter. For both transcripts, alternative splicing gives rise to 3 different C termini, designated alpha, beta, and gamma.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance.

Northern blotting revealed that PTPR-kappa is expressed as a 7.0-kb transcript in a variety of tissues.

The DNA was transferred to NIH 3T3 cells by the calcium precipitation technique. Transforming ability was shown by 3 samples: a primary cancer, a metastatic cancer, and a presumably normal gastric mucosa. The transforming gene from the primary cancer was cloned. It bore no homology with previously reported transforming sequences. Taira et al. (1987) isolated an HST cDNA clone that had an efficient transforming activity in a focus-forming assay when it was inserted into an expression vector. Characterization of this clone allowed Taira et al. (1987) to predict that a 206-amino acid protein product was responsible for this transforming activity. In an addendum, Taira et al. (1987) indicated that 42.3% homology existed between the amino acid residues of 1 ORF (open reading frame) of HST and part of bovine basic fibroblast growth factor. They suggested that further studies would elucidate the role of the HST gene in the development of stomach cancer which, they stated, has the highest incidence of all known cancers.
