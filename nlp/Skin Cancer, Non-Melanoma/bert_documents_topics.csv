Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

AJs may also function in the transmission of the 'contact inhibition' signal, which instructs cells to stop dividing once an epithelial sheet is complete (summary by Peifer, 1993).";beta catenin adherens junction protein adherens junctions ajs also called zonula adherens critical establishment maintenance epithelial layers lining organ surfaces ajs mediate adhesion cells communicate signal neighboring cells present anchor actin cytoskeleton serving roles ajs regulate normal cell growth behavior several stages embryogenesis wound healing tumor cell metastasis cells form leave epithelia process involves disruption reestablishment epithelial cell cell contacts may regulated disassembly assembly ajs ajs may also function transmission contact inhibition signal instructs cells stop dividing epithelial sheet complete summary peifer;3

Northern blot analysis revealed wide, perhaps ubiquitous, expression.

The S1 proteins are a group of nuclear proteins that occur in association with hnRNA in the cell nucleus. Inoue et al. (1996) cloned a rat homolog of human KIAA0122, which they termed S1-1. Based on protein microsequences, they noted that the rat S1-1 sequence had 2 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) motifs but was distinct from other S1 proteins. They showed that the S1-1 protein has RNA-binding activity.

A second class includes dimeric receptors such as the insulin receptor as well as several protooncogenes such as MET (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>) and ROS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165020"">165020</a>).

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

Di Iorio et al. (2005) stated that the p63 gene generates 6 isoforms. The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter. For both transcripts, alternative splicing gives rise to 3 different C termini, designated alpha, beta, and gamma.

This sequence, which they called PKS (presumably for 'protein kinase sequence'), showed 71% nucleotide homology to RAF1. The predicted amino acid sequence of the kinase domain was sufficiently like the sequence of v-raf to suggest that PKS may encode a polypeptide with serine/threonine kinase activity. Mark et al.

FBP exhibited DNA binding specificity for the noncoding strand of the FUSE site in vitro. By PCR of human cell line cDNA with degenerate primers based on a partial FBP protein sequence, the authors isolated partial FBP cDNAs. They recovered additional cDNAs from several libraries and used them to assemble a full-length FBP cDNA sequence. The central region of the predicted 644-amino acid protein contains 4 copies of a repeat unit. In vitro binding assays with mutant protein constructs indicated that the third and fourth copies constituted the minimum single-stranded DNA-binding domain. Using potassium permanganate to probe DNA conformation in vivo, Duncan et al. (1994) determined that the pattern of sensitivity of genomic DNA was consistent with the binding of FBP to the noncoding strand of FUSE, which displaced the coding strand. Expression of FBP in human leukemia cells stimulated the activity of a MYC promoter in a FUSE-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of the 2.6-kb FBP mRNA declined upon differentiation, suggesting that FUSE-binding activity may be regulated transcriptionally.

Elevated cAMP levels cause stimulation and nuclear translocation of protein kinase A (PKA; see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/176911"">176911</a>), which activates the transcription factor CREB (CRE-binding protein; see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/123810"">123810</a>) by phosphorylating it at a single residue, serine-133 (Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989).

Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein. CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

Alternative splicing resulted in 2 distinct BCLX mRNAs. The protein product of the larger mRNA (BCLXL) was similar in size and predicted structure to BCL2. When stably transfected into an IL3-dependent cell line, it inhibited cell death upon growth factor withdrawal at least as well as BCL2. Unexpectedly, the smaller mRNA species (BCLXS) encodes a protein that inhibits the ability of BCL2 to enhance the survival of growth factor-deprived cells. In vivo, the smaller BCLX mRNA was expressed at high levels in cells that undergo a high rate of turnover, such as developing lymphocytes. In contrast, the large form of BCLX was found in tissues containing long-lived postmitotic cells, such as adult brain. Together these data suggested that BCLX plays an important role in both positive and negative regulation of programmed cell death. Boise et al.

The chromosome 18 gene was symbolized SYT by Clark et al. (1994). Sequencing of cDNA clones showed that the normal SYT gene encodes a protein rich in glutamine, proline, and glycine.

The SYT protein appears to act as a transcriptional coactivator and the SSX proteins as corepressors. Thaete et al. (1999) found that the SYT protein contains a novel 54-amino acid domain at its N terminus (the SNH domain) that is conserved in proteins from a wide variety of species. SYT also has a C-terminal domain, designated the QPGY domain because it is rich in glutamine, proline, glycine, and tyrosine, that contains the transcriptional activator sequences.

The mouse homolog of SS18 was isolated and sequenced in full by de Bruijn et al. (1996), who referred to the gene as Syt.

Protein-tyrosine kinases in the central nervous system are activated in response to a variety of neurotrophic factors that control neuronal differentiation and survival via cell surface receptors. Also, protein phosphorylation is involved in membrane excitability and the function of ion channels. Lev et al. (1995) discovered a nonreceptor type protein kinase that is highly expressed in adult rat brain. The kinase, which they symbolized PYK2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2), was cloned from a rat spinal cord cDNA library using degenerate PCR primers corresponding to conserved tyrosine kinase motifs of PYK1 (see Manser et al., 1993). Lev et al. (1995) cloned the human homolog from a human fetal brain cDNA library using the rat sequence as a probe.
