RB1_SNP;0.0267403426314996;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al.

Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

FLT3_SNP;0.0070443088416911;FLT3;"FMS-RELATED TYROSINE KINASE 3; FLT3";live;"The growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family comprises several classes with distinct structural features. Ullrich and Schlessinger (1990) distinguished 4 classes. One class is represented by the ERBB family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164870"">164870</a>). A second class includes dimeric receptors such as the insulin receptor as well as several protooncogenes such as MET (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>) and ROS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165020"">165020</a>). A third class is characterized by the presence of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and by the interruption of the catalytic domain in 2 parts by a specific hydrophilic 'interkinase' sequence of variable length. This class includes the protooncogene FMS, which encodes the CSF1 receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), which corresponds to the 'white spotting' locus in the mouse, as well as 2 PDGF receptor genes (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>) and FLT1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165070"">165070</a>). A fourth class is represented by the fibroblast growth factor receptors encoded by FLG (FLT2; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/136350"">136350</a>) and BEK (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/176943"">176943</a>). These receptors have strong sequence similarities to the products of the third class but possess only 3 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and a short kinase insert in the intracellular domain. By screening human and mouse testis cDNA libraries with an FMS probe, Rosnet et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNAs encoding human and mouse FLT3, a novel member of the class 3 receptors. FLT3 belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and has strong sequence similarities with other members of the group.

The ability to isolate and expand this population has clinical applications in bone marrow transplantations for cancer and genetic diseases. Small et al.

This sequence, which they called PKS (presumably for 'protein kinase sequence'), showed 71% nucleotide homology to RAF1.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein. CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

The authors stated that if the frameshift is ignored, the full-length putative 289-amino acid protein shares 71% sequence identity with the predicted mouse protein, and the mouse and human RAD51D genes have 2 conserved ATP-binding domains similar to other RecA-related genes.

Cartwright et al. (1998) also isolated human and mouse RAD51L3, or R51H3, cDNAs. They found that the sequence of the predicted 328-amino acid human protein is 82% identical to that of mouse RAD51L3. Northern blot analysis revealed that human RAD51L3 is expressed as a 1.7-kb mRNA in all tissues, with the highest levels in testis.

Kawabata and Saeki (1999) cloned RAD51L3, which they called TRAD, from a placenta cDNA library based on sequence similarity with the mouse gene. They obtained the full-length cDNA by PCR of adult and fetal brain cDNA libraries. The deduced 328-amino acid protein contains both A and B nucleotide-binding motifs and shares 83% sequence identity with the mouse protein. Kawabata and Saeki (1999) also identified several truncated variants, 1 of which lacks the nucleotide-binding sites, that result from exon skipping.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

Di Iorio et al. (2005) stated that the p63 gene generates 6 isoforms. The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter. For both transcripts, alternative splicing gives rise to 3 different C termini, designated alpha, beta, and gamma.

PKs can be grouped based on sequence similarities and on specificity for the acceptor amino acid. Most PKs phosphorylate either serine/threonine or tyrosine. Some PKs, referred to as mixed-lineage kinases (e.g., MAP3K9; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600136"">600136</a>), have features of both serine/threonine and tyrosine PKs. All PKs have Src homology (SH) domains (see MAP3K11; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600050"">600050</a>). PKs can also be grouped as receptors or nonreceptors. Receptor PKs have a transmembrane region, an extracellular ligand-binding domain, and an intracellular catalytic domain.

By screening a human cerebellum cDNA library with a rat brain cDNA of unknown function, Sakuma et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel PK, MAP3K13, which they called LZK (leucine zipper-bearing kinase). Sequence analysis showed that the deduced 966-amino acid MAP3K13 protein has no apparent signal sequence or transmembrane region but does contain a kinase catalytic domain, a double leucine/isoleucine zipper, and an acidic domain at its C-terminal end. The MAP3K13 catalytic domain has features of both serine/threonine PKs and tyrosine PKs. MAP3K13 shares 86.4% amino acid identity with MAP3K12 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600447"">600447</a>), a mixed-lineage kinase.

A critical protein kinase lies upstream of MAP kinase and stimulates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinase. Crews et al. (1992) cloned a mouse cDNA, denoted Mek1 (for Map/Erk kinase-1) by them, that encodes a member of this protein kinase family. The 393-amino acid, 43.5-kD protein is most closely related in size and sequence to the product encoded by the byr1 gene of S. pombe. The Mek1 gene was highly expressed in murine brain.

The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development.

(1989) identified a genomic sequence and a cloned cDNA for a novel receptor-like gene of the PDGF receptor/CSF1 receptor family. The gene recognized a 6.4-kb transcript that was coexpressed in normal human tissues with the 5.3-kb PDGF receptor mRNA. The characteristics of the new receptor were different from the previously known one (PDGFR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>). Matsui et al. (1989) suggested that the existence of genes encoding 2 PDGF receptors that interact in a distinct manner with 3 different PDGF isoforms may confer regulatory flexibility in functional responses to PDGF.

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al. (2003) demonstrated that idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607685"">607685</a>) is often caused by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in fusion of PDGFRA and FIP1L1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607686"">607686</a>), a neighboring gene. The PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that transforms hematopoietic cells and is a therapeutic target of imatinib. Cools et al.
