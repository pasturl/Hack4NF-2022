In addition, p53 appears to induce apoptosis through nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes. In unstressed cells, p53 is kept inactive essentially through the actions of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164785"">164785</a>), which inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and ubiquitinates p53 to promote its degradation. Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity. Activity of p53 is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by mutation of the p53 gene itself or by loss of cell signaling upstream or downstream of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Bourdon, 2007; Vousden and Lane, 2007).";transcription factor p responds diverse cellular stresses regulate target genes induce cell cycle arrest apoptosis senescence dna repair changes metabolism addition p appears induce apoptosis nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes unstressed cells p kept inactive essentially actions ubiquitin ligase mdm entry inhibits p transcriptional activity ubiquitinates p promote degradation numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p activity notably phosphorylation acetylation several less abundant p isoforms also modulate p activity activity p ubiquitously lost human cancer either mutation p gene loss cell signaling upstream downstream p toledo wahl bourdon vousden lane;-1

This process, which involves the disruption and reestablishment of epithelial cell-cell contacts, may be regulated by the disassembly and assembly of AJs.

(1991) found by molecular cloning and characterization of this gene, which they termed AXL (from the Greek word 'anexelekto,' or uncontrolled), that it is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a structure novel among tyrosine kinases. They showed that the AXL protein is capable of transforming NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, its transforming capacity results from overexpression of AXL mRNA rather than from structural mutation.

Janssen et al. (1991) independently found transforming activity by a tumorigenicity assay using NIH 3T3 cells transfected with DNA from a patient with a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. They reported the cDNA cloning of the corresponding oncogene, which they designated UFO, in allusion to the unidentified function of the protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 2,682-bp open reading frame capable of directing the synthesis of an 894-amino acid polypeptide. It was evolutionarily conserved among vertebrate species. The predicted protein showed features characteristic of a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. The gene was transcribed into two 5.0-kb and 3.2-kb mRNAs in human bone marrow and human tumor cell lines.";effort determine genes involved progression chronic myelogenous leukemia cml entry acute phase leukemia liu identified transforming gene dnas patients disorder bryan found molecular cloning characterization gene termed axl greek word anexelekto uncontrolled receptor tyrosine kinase structure novel among tyrosine kinases showed axl protein capable transforming nih cells furthermore transforming capacity results overexpression axl mrna rather structural mutation janssen independently found transforming activity tumorigenicity assay using nih cells transfected dna patient chronic myeloproliferative disorder reported cdna cloning corresponding oncogene designated ufo allusion unidentified function protein nucleotide sequence analysis revealed bp open reading frame capable directing synthesis amino acid polypeptide evolutionarily conserved among vertebrate species predicted protein showed features characteristic transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase activity gene transcribed two kb kb mrnas human bone marrow human tumor cell lines;0

DICER1 possesses an RNA helicase motif containing a DEXH box in its amino terminus and an RNA motif in the carboxy terminus DICER, also known as helicase-MOI, is required by the RNA interference and small temporal RNA (stRNA) pathways to produce the active small RNA component that represses gene expression (Matsuda et al., 2000).

Evidence also suggests that DICER1 may act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene (Bahubeshi et al., 2010; Rio Frio et al., 2011).";dicer gene member ribonuclease iii rnaseiii family involved generation micrornas mirnas modulate gene expression posttranscriptional level summary rio frio dicer possesses rna helicase motif containing dexh box amino terminus rna motif carboxy terminus dicer also known helicase moi required rna interference small temporal rna strna pathways produce active small rna component represses gene expression matsuda evidence also suggests dicer may act haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene bahubeshi rio frio;1
