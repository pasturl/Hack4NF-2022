Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

These receptors have strong sequence similarities to the products of the third class but possess only 3 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and a short kinase insert in the intracellular domain. By screening human and mouse testis cDNA libraries with an FMS probe, Rosnet et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNAs encoding human and mouse FLT3, a novel member of the class 3 receptors. FLT3 belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and has strong sequence similarities with other members of the group.

Lymphohematopoietic stem cells serve as a reservoir for virtually all blood cells but make up only approximately 0.01% of human or murine marrow cells. The ability to isolate and expand this population has clinical applications in bone marrow transplantations for cancer and genetic diseases. Small et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA for FLT3, which they called STK1, from a CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell-enriched library. The cDNA encodes a protein of 993 amino acids with 85% identity to the murine homolog. STK1 is a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family that includes KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), FMS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>).

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al.

RNase protection assays showed that this gene, termed UNR by them, is transcribed in the same direction as NRAS and that its 3-prime end is located only 130 bp from the transcription initiation site of NRAS. The close spatial relationship was conserved in all species from which the NRAS gene had been isolated. The UNR cDNA contained an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 798 amino acids. UNR transcripts were detected in mouse, rat, and human cells. Only a single copy of UNR was detected in the mouse. The gene produced multiple transcripts that differed in their 3-prime ends and apparently resulted from the differential use of multiple polyadenylation sites located in the 3-prime untranslated region of the gene. Both UNR and NRAS were expressed in all tissues examined and the 2 genes may be coordinately regulated. UNR was first isolated by Doniger and DiPaolo (1988) in tumorigenic guinea pig cells.

GATA3 had been shown in the chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc finger domain. GATA3 mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in T cells but not in B cells, macrophages, or HeLa cell lines. GATA3 was abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte lineage and was thought to participate in T-cell receptor gene activation through binding to enhancers. Labastie et al.

It also has a C-terminal endonuclease domain homologous to that of ERCC4, but sequence degeneracy suggests that it is inactive.

By immunohistochemical analysis of human testicular tissue sections, Kasak et al. (2018) observed localization of FANCM to the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules. Staining intensity was related to stage of maturation, with faint staining of spermatogonia, increased staining in primary spermatocytes to spermatids, and reduced staining in tubules with mature spermatozoa. FANCM expression was also present in the interstitial Leydig cells.

Fouquet et al.

Cell-sorting experiments revealed that FANCM transcripts were predominant in oogonial cells compared to somatic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human fetal ovaries showed that FANCM protein was present in the nuclei of oogonia, with strongest staining in pachytene stage oocytes.

DNA topoisomerases ({EC 5.99.1.3}) are enzymes that control and alter the topologic states of DNA in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Topoisomerase II from eukaryotic cells catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled DNA molecules, catenation, decatenation, knotting, and unknotting of circular DNA. It appears likely that the reaction catalyzed by topoisomerase II involves the crossing-over of 2 DNA segments. Miller et al. (1981) estimated that there are about 100,000 molecules of topoisomerase II per HeLa cell nucleus, constituting about 0.1% of the nuclear extract. Since several of the abnormal characteristics of ataxia-telangiectasia (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/208900"">208900</a>) appear to be due to defects in DNA processing, Singh et al. (1988) screened for these enzyme activities in 5 AT cell lines. In comparison to controls, the level of DNA topoisomerase II, determined by unknotting of P4 phage DNA, was reduced substantially in 4 of these cell lines and to a lesser extent in the fifth. DNA topoisomerase I, assayed by relaxation of supercoil DNA, was found to be present at normal levels.

Tsai-Pflugfelder et al. (1988) determined the entire coding sequence of the human TOP2 gene.

Chung et al. (1989) sequenced human cDNAs that had been isolated by screening a cDNA library derived from a mechlorethamine-resistant Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Raji-HN2) with a Drosophila Topo II cDNA. They identified 2 classes of sequence representing 2 TOP2 isoenzymes, which have been named TOP2A and TOP2B (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/126431"">126431</a>). The sequence of 1 of the TOP2A cDNAs is identical to that of an internal fragment of the TOP2 cDNA isolated by Tsai-Pflugfelder et al. (1988). Southern blot analysis indicated that the TOP2A and TOP2B cDNAs are derived from distinct genes. Northern blot analysis using a TOP2A-specific probe detected a 6.5-kb transcript in the human cell line U937. Antibodies against a TOP2A peptide recognized a 170-kD protein in U937 cell lysates.

Using rat Fat3 to query human EST and genome databases, Katoh and Katoh (2006) identified full-length human FAT3. The deduced 4,557-amino acid protein contains 33 cadherin repeats, a laminin G domain, and 2 EGF domains in its extracellular region, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain containing a PDZ-binding motif. In silico analysis detected FAT3 mRNAs in embryonic stem cells, primitive neuroectoderm, fetal brain, infant brain, and adult neural tissues and prostate.";mitsui cloned rat fat cdna identified partial human fat cdna database analysis amino acid rat protein n terminal signal peptide followed cadherin see cdh entry domains egf entry like motif laminin see lama entry g domain additional egf like motifs transmembrane domain cytoplasmic c terminal tail immunofluorescence staining detected predominant fat expression fetal rat central nervous system using rat fat query human est genome databases katoh katoh identified full length human fat deduced amino acid protein contains cadherin repeats laminin g domain egf domains extracellular region followed transmembrane domain cytoplasmic c terminal domain containing pdz binding motif silico analysis detected fat mrnas embryonic stem cells primitive neuroectoderm fetal brain infant brain adult neural tissues prostate;-1
