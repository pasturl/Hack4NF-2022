Using the ALL1 SET domain as a probe, Prasad et al. (1997) cloned a novel gene, KMT2D, which they designated ALR (ALL1-related gene). The gene encodes a 5,262-amino acid protein containing a SET domain, 5 PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a long run of glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues (mostly leucine). They also detected an alternatively spliced form encoding 4,957 amino acids and lacking an N-terminal zinc finger and PHD finger. Analysis of ALR expression showed that its approximately 18-kb transcript is expressed, like ALL1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic cells, but not in liver. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of early mouse embryos indicated expression of a similar mouse gene in multiple tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern, Prasad et al.

Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein.

An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

The cDNA encodes a predicted 449-amino acid protein that is highly conserved among vertebrates and includes 2 adjacent zinc finger/basic domains characteristic of the GATA factor family. The gene is transcribed in a pattern overlapping that of GATA4 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600576"">600576</a>). Transcripts for both of these genes are prominent in heart, pancreas, and ovary, but only GATA6 mRNA was found in lung and liver. GATA6 transcripts were also detected in cultures of human and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. In these cells, GATA6 transcripts were downregulated when quiescent cultures were stimulated to proliferate in response to mitogen activation.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Wong-Staal et al.

Non-onc intervening sequences were present in the human counterpart, which is rather highly conserved in mammalian evolution and probably plays a role in normal cell growth or differentiation. Allelic variation in the human onc HaMSV gene was identified. The transforming genes of retroviruses are derived from a group of cellular genes that are highly conserved evolutionarily.

Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF.

The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

A key feature of MLL fusion proteins is their ability to efficiently transform hematopoietic cells into leukemia stem cells (Krivtsov and Armstrong, 2007).";kmt gene mll encodes dna binding protein methylates histone h see entry lys h k positively regulates expression target genes including multiple hox genes see entry mll frequent target recurrent translocations acute leukemias may characterized acute myeloid leukemia aml entry acute lymphoblastic leukemia mixed lineage biphenotypic leukemia mll leukemias translocations involving mll possess unique clinical biologic characteristics often associated poor prognosis mll rearrangements found infant leukemias whether immunophenotype consistent aml less frequent leukemias older children mll translocations also found approximately amls adults well therapy related leukemias often characterized aml develop patients previously treated topoisomerase ii inhibitors malignancies different mll fusion partners identified leukemogenic mll translocations encode mll fusion proteins lost h k methyltransferase activity key feature mll fusion proteins ability efficiently transform hematopoietic cells leukemia stem cells krivtsov armstrong;0
COL1A1_SNP;0.0010491250571782;COL1A1;"COLLAGEN, TYPE I, ALPHA-1; COL1A1";live;"Collagen has a triple-stranded rope-like coiled structure. The major collagen of skin, tendon, and bone is the same protein containing 2 alpha-1 polypeptide chains and 1 alpha-2 chain. Although these are long (the procollagen chain has a molecular mass of about 120 kD, before the 'registration peptide' is cleaved off; see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/225410"">225410</a>), each messenger RNA is monocistronic (Lazarides and Lukens, 1971). Differences in the collagens from these 3 tissues are a function of the degree of hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, aldehyde formation for cross-linking, and glycosylation. The alpha-1 chain of the collagen of cartilage and that of the collagen of basement membrane are determined by different structural genes. The collagen of cartilage contains only 1 type of polypeptide chain, alpha-1, and this is determined by a distinct locus. The fetus contains collagen of distinctive structure. The genes for types I, II, and III collagens, the interstitial collagens, exhibit an unusual and characteristic structure of a large number of relatively small exons (54 and 108 bp) at evolutionarily conserved positions along the length of the triple-helical gly-X-Y portion (Boedtker et al., 1983). The family of collagen proteins consists of a minimum of 9 types of collagen molecules whose constituent chains are encoded by a minimum of 17 genes (Ninomiya and Olsen, 1984).";collagen triple stranded rope like coiled structure major collagen skin tendon bone protein containing alpha polypeptide chains alpha chain although long procollagen chain molecular mass kd registration peptide cleaved see entry messenger rna monocistronic lazarides lukens differences collagens tissues function degree hydroxylation proline lysine residues aldehyde formation cross linking glycosylation alpha chain collagen cartilage collagen basement membrane determined different structural genes collagen cartilage contains type polypeptide chain alpha determined distinct locus fetus contains collagen distinctive structure genes types ii iii collagens interstitial collagens exhibit unusual characteristic structure large number relatively small exons bp evolutionarily conserved positions along length triple helical gly x portion boedtker family collagen proteins consists minimum types collagen molecules whose constituent chains encoded minimum genes ninomiya olsen;0

The CSF1R gene is expressed in mononuclear phagocytes in the brain, known as microglia, which play a role in neuronal and brain development (summary by Erblich et al., 2011), as well as in osteoclasts, which play an important role in bone mineralization (summary by Dai et al., 2004).
