Using the ALL1 SET domain as a probe, Prasad et al. (1997) cloned a novel gene, KMT2D, which they designated ALR (ALL1-related gene). The gene encodes a 5,262-amino acid protein containing a SET domain, 5 PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a long run of glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues (mostly leucine). They also detected an alternatively spliced form encoding 4,957 amino acids and lacking an N-terminal zinc finger and PHD finger. Analysis of ALR expression showed that its approximately 18-kb transcript is expressed, like ALL1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic cells, but not in liver. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of early mouse embryos indicated expression of a similar mouse gene in multiple tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern, Prasad et al.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>).

The yeast Rad50, Mre11 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600814"">600814</a>), and Xrs2 proteins appear to act in a multiprotein complex, consistent with the observation that mutations in these genes confer nearly identical phenotypes of no meiotic recombination and elevated rates of homologous mitotic recombination. By direct selection of cDNAs from the 5q23-q31 chromosomal interval, Dolganov et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding a human Rad50 homolog. The human RAD50 gene spans 100 to 130 kb. Northern blot analysis revealed that the RAD50 gene was expressed as a 5.5-kb mRNA predominantly in testis. A faint 7-kb transcript, which the authors considered to be an mRNA with an alternatively processed 3-prime end, was also detected. Yeast Rad50 and the predicted 1,312-amino acid human RAD50 protein share more than 50% identity in their N- and C-termini.

They showed that the AXL protein is capable of transforming NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, its transforming capacity results from overexpression of AXL mRNA rather than from structural mutation.

Janssen et al. (1991) independently found transforming activity by a tumorigenicity assay using NIH 3T3 cells transfected with DNA from a patient with a chronic myeloproliferative disorder.
