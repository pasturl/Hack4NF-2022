Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity. Activity of p53 is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by mutation of the p53 gene itself or by loss of cell signaling upstream or downstream of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Bourdon, 2007; Vousden and Lane, 2007).";transcription factor p responds diverse cellular stresses regulate target genes induce cell cycle arrest apoptosis senescence dna repair changes metabolism addition p appears induce apoptosis nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes unstressed cells p kept inactive essentially actions ubiquitin ligase mdm entry inhibits p transcriptional activity ubiquitinates p promote degradation numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p activity notably phosphorylation acetylation several less abundant p isoforms also modulate p activity activity p ubiquitously lost human cancer either mutation p gene loss cell signaling upstream downstream p toledo wahl bourdon vousden lane;6

RB1_SNP;0.0173552677443681;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Immunoblot analysis of human cell lines showed that endogenous LATS2 is a nuclear protein of approximately 125 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 5.8-kb LATS2 transcript in several human tissues, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.

This sequence, which they called PKS (presumably for 'protein kinase sequence'), showed 71% nucleotide homology to RAF1.

Using mass spectrometry, Meetei et al. (2005) identified another component, FAAP250, as KIAA1596. Antibodies raised against KIAA1596 specifically recognized the 250-kD polypeptide of the Fanconi anemia core complex immunopurified using antibodies against FANCA (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607139"">607139</a>). FAAP250, or FANCM, has sequence similarity to DNA repair proteins, including archaeal Hef, yeast MPH1, and human ERCC4 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133520"">133520</a>). The deduced 2,048-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal helicase domain homologous to those of DEAH box helicases (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607570"">607570</a>) or DNA-stimulated ATPases. It also has a C-terminal endonuclease domain homologous to that of ERCC4, but sequence degeneracy suggests that it is inactive.

By immunohistochemical analysis of human testicular tissue sections, Kasak et al. (2018) observed localization of FANCM to the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules. Staining intensity was related to stage of maturation, with faint staining of spermatogonia, increased staining in primary spermatocytes to spermatids, and reduced staining in tubules with mature spermatozoa. FANCM expression was also present in the interstitial Leydig cells.

Fouquet et al. (2017) performed qRT-PCR in germ cells from human fetal ovaries and observed expression throughout ovarian development, with highest expression in ovaries at stages containing the highest proportion of germ cells progressing into meiotic prophase I. Cell-sorting experiments revealed that FANCM transcripts were predominant in oogonial cells compared to somatic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human fetal ovaries showed that FANCM protein was present in the nuclei of oogonia, with strongest staining in pachytene stage oocytes. In addition, staining localized along the chromosomes in pachytene cells undergoing meiotic recombination. FANCM was also observed in oocytes arrested at the diplotene stage of prophase I during the last trimester of pregnancy and in adults.

HGF_SNP;0.0013422839254502;HGF;"HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR; HGF";live;"Plasma from patients with fulminant hepatic failure contains a factor that stimulates the growth of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance. The authors speculated that knowledge of the evolutionarily divergent chicken Brca2 sequence may be useful in distinguishing sequence variants from mutations in the human BRCA2 gene.";wooster identified brca gene positional cloning region chromosome q q implicated icelandic families breast cancer entry candidate disease gene likely located kb interval centered around using yeast artificial chromosome p artificial chromosome contigs identify trapped exons within region wooster screened human fetal brain placental monocyte breast cancer cdna libraries identified cdna encoding amino acid protein suggested may represent entire gene northern blot analysis demonstrated expression normal breast epithelial cells placenta breast cancer cell line mcf tavtigian determined complete coding sequence exonic structure brca examined pattern expression composite brca cdna sequence assembled consisted bp include polyadenylation signal poly tail conceptual translation cdna revealed orf beginning nucleotide encoding protein amino acids signal sequence end terminus obvious membrane spanning regions highest levels expression observed breast thymus slightly lower levels lung ovary spleen tavtigian noted brca protein like brca protein entry highly charged roughly one quarter residues acidic basic connor described mouse brca gene sequenced cdna entire amino acid brca protein found like brca brca relatively poorly conserved humans mice approximately brca transcribed diverse range mouse tissues especially testis ovary midgestation embryo brca also expressed mammary gland apparently induced upon pregnancy pattern expression strikingly similar brca warren cloned characterized chicken brca gene gene organized similarly human brca gene compact chicken gene encodes protein amino acids poorly conserved mammalian brca proteins overall amino acid sequence identity human brca however certain domains much highly conserved indicating functional significance authors speculated knowledge evolutionarily divergent chicken brca sequence may useful distinguishing sequence variants mutations human brca gene;1

Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. Imbalances in glutamatergic function have been implicated in neuronal death following ischemia, in hypoglycemia or anoxia, in epilepsy, and in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate actions are mediated by glutamate receptors which fall into 2 distinct classes: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels whose responses to selective agonists define the N-methyl-D-aspartate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxasole-4-propionate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138248"">138248</a>), and kainate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138245"">138245</a>) subtypes. Metabotropic glutamate receptors, such as GRM3, which are coupled through GTP-binding proteins to second-messenger pathways, can be involved in the stimulation of phospholipase C, the presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release, the closure of cation channels in retinal ON bipolar cells, and the modulation of adenylate cyclase.

Duncan et al. (1994) purified a 70-kD FUSE-binding protein, or FBP, that is present in undifferentiated but not differentiated cells. FBP exhibited DNA binding specificity for the noncoding strand of the FUSE site in vitro. By PCR of human cell line cDNA with degenerate primers based on a partial FBP protein sequence, the authors isolated partial FBP cDNAs. They recovered additional cDNAs from several libraries and used them to assemble a full-length FBP cDNA sequence. The central region of the predicted 644-amino acid protein contains 4 copies of a repeat unit. In vitro binding assays with mutant protein constructs indicated that the third and fourth copies constituted the minimum single-stranded DNA-binding domain. Using potassium permanganate to probe DNA conformation in vivo, Duncan et al. (1994) determined that the pattern of sensitivity of genomic DNA was consistent with the binding of FBP to the noncoding strand of FUSE, which displaced the coding strand. Expression of FBP in human leukemia cells stimulated the activity of a MYC promoter in a FUSE-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of the 2.6-kb FBP mRNA declined upon differentiation, suggesting that FUSE-binding activity may be regulated transcriptionally. In addition, by sequence analysis of FBP cDNAs, the authors found evidence that FBP activity may also be regulated by alternative splicing, translation efficiency, and posttranslational modification.";far upstream element fuse human myc entry protooncogene stimulates expression undifferentiated cells duncan purified kd fuse binding protein fbp present undifferentiated differentiated cells fbp exhibited dna binding specificity noncoding strand fuse site vitro pcr human cell line cdna degenerate primers based partial fbp protein sequence authors isolated partial fbp cdnas recovered additional cdnas several libraries used assemble full length fbp cdna sequence central region predicted amino acid protein contains copies repeat unit vitro binding assays mutant protein constructs indicated third fourth copies constituted minimum single stranded dna binding domain using potassium permanganate probe dna conformation vivo duncan determined pattern sensitivity genomic dna consistent binding fbp noncoding strand fuse displaced coding strand expression fbp human leukemia cells stimulated activity myc promoter fuse dependent manner northern blot analysis revealed expression kb fbp mrna declined upon differentiation suggesting fuse binding activity may regulated transcriptionally addition sequence analysis fbp cdnas authors found evidence fbp activity may also regulated alternative splicing translation efficiency posttranslational modification;-1
