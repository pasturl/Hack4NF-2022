GATA3 mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in T cells but not in B cells, macrophages, or HeLa cell lines.

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al. (2003) demonstrated that idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607685"">607685</a>) is often caused by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in fusion of PDGFRA and FIP1L1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607686"">607686</a>), a neighboring gene. The PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that transforms hematopoietic cells and is a therapeutic target of imatinib. Cools et al.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

They then isolated a cDNA using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptide fragments of the purified protein. The putative FGFB receptor encoded by this cDNA was found to be a transmembrane protein that contained 3 extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, an unusual acidic region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

Di Iorio et al. (2005) stated that the p63 gene generates 6 isoforms. The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter. For both transcripts, alternative splicing gives rise to 3 different C termini, designated alpha, beta, and gamma.

A third class is characterized by the presence of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and by the interruption of the catalytic domain in 2 parts by a specific hydrophilic 'interkinase' sequence of variable length. This class includes the protooncogene FMS, which encodes the CSF1 receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), which corresponds to the 'white spotting' locus in the mouse, as well as 2 PDGF receptor genes (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>) and FLT1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165070"">165070</a>).

By screening human and mouse testis cDNA libraries with an FMS probe, Rosnet et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNAs encoding human and mouse FLT3, a novel member of the class 3 receptors. FLT3 belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and has strong sequence similarities with other members of the group.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance.

It regulates gene expression and stimulates mitogenesis and appears to mediate insulin/IGF1-stimulated glucose transport. Thus, the finding that the homozygous Irs1 knockout mouse survives with only mild resistance to hypertension was surprising. This dilemma was provisionally resolved by the discovery by Sun et al. (1995) of a second IRS signaling protein in mouse. They purified and cloned a likely candidate from mouse myeloid progenitor cells and, because of its resemblance to IRS1, they designated it IRS2. Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

Topoisomerase II from eukaryotic cells catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled DNA molecules, catenation, decatenation, knotting, and unknotting of circular DNA. It appears likely that the reaction catalyzed by topoisomerase II involves the crossing-over of 2 DNA segments. Miller et al. (1981) estimated that there are about 100,000 molecules of topoisomerase II per HeLa cell nucleus, constituting about 0.1% of the nuclear extract. Since several of the abnormal characteristics of ataxia-telangiectasia (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/208900"">208900</a>) appear to be due to defects in DNA processing, Singh et al. (1988) screened for these enzyme activities in 5 AT cell lines.

DNA topoisomerase I, assayed by relaxation of supercoil DNA, was found to be present at normal levels.

Kim et al. (2002) reported that MTOR forms a stoichiometric complex with RAPTOR, an evolutionarily conserved protein with at least 2 roles in the MTOR pathway. They cloned the full-length cDNA for RAPTOR, which contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with 1,335 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 149 kD. A previously identified partial cDNA, KIAA1303 (Nagase et al., 2000), is contained within the RAPTOR cDNA. All RAPTOR homologs have a novel N-terminal domain the authors called RNC (RAPTOR N-terminal conserved) that consists of 3 blocks with at least 67 to 79% sequence similarity and is predicted to have a high propensity to form alpha helices. Following the RNC domain, all RAPTOR homologs have 3 HEAT repeats, which are followed by 7 WD40 repeats in the C-terminal third of the protein. Northern blot analysis showed that RAPTOR is expressed in all tissues in a pattern similar to that of MTOR, with the highest levels of both mRNAs in skeletal muscle, brain, kidney, and placenta.

(1984) derived a DNA clone that was specific for the t(14;18) translocation. The probe detected rearrangement of the homologous DNA segment in leukemic cells and in follicular lymphoma cells with the t(14;18) chromosome translocation but not in other neoplastic or normal B or T cells. Tsujimoto et al. (1984) concluded that the probe identified the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18q21 that was unrelated to known oncogenes and may be important in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms with this translocation.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

Tsujimoto et al. (1985) found that their most specific probe hybridized to cellular DNA from hamster and mouse under stringent conditions, indicating that at least part of the BCL2 gene is conserved across mammalian species as are many cellular oncogenes. Negrini et al. (1987) cloned the murine gene homologous to BCL2 in man.

<Subhead> BRAG1: A Spurious 'BCL2-related' Gene

Das et al. (1996) reported the isolation and molecular characterization of a novel Bcl2-related cDNA from a human glioma. They designated the gene BRAG1 for 'brain related apoptosis gene.' They gene showed extensive homology to the BCL2 family of genes. The gene was expressed in normal brain as a 4.5-kb transcript and as a 1.8-kb transcript in human gliomas, which suggested to the authors that it may be rearranged in these tumors. The open reading frame of the BRAG1 gene encoded a protein of 31 kD. Using a bacterial expression vector, Das et al. (1996) produced BRAG1 protein that was found to crossreact with a BCL2 monoclonal antibody, further suggesting structural and immunologic similarity to BCL2. In an erratum, the authors concluded that the gene in question was in fact from the genome of Escherichia coli and occurred as a contaminant in cDNA libraries.";cell line studied pegoraro showed translocations characteristic burkitt lymphoma see entry follicular lymphoma see entry respectively tsujimoto derived dna clone specific translocation probe detected rearrangement homologous dna segment leukemic cells follicular lymphoma cells chromosome translocation neoplastic normal b cells tsujimoto concluded probe identified bcl gene chromosome q unrelated known oncogenes may important pathogenesis b cell neoplasms translocation human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line cleary cloned cdnas bcl nucleotide sequence analysis showed kb bcl mrna potentially encodes kd protein homologous predicted epstein barr virus protein tsujimoto croce determined first exon bcl transcribed kb mrna exon contains splicing donor signal bcl mrna spliced second exon produce kb mrna kb mrnas code bcl alpha beta proteins respectively identical except c terminal portion tsujimoto found specific probe hybridized cellular dna hamster mouse stringent conditions indicating least part bcl gene conserved across mammalian species many cellular oncogenes negrini cloned murine gene homologous bcl man subhead brag spurious bcl related gene das reported isolation molecular characterization novel bcl related cdna human glioma designated gene brag brain related apoptosis gene gene showed extensive homology bcl family genes gene expressed normal brain kb transcript kb transcript human gliomas suggested authors may rearranged tumors open reading frame brag gene encoded protein kd using bacterial expression vector das produced brag protein found crossreact bcl monoclonal antibody suggesting structural immunologic similarity bcl erratum authors concluded gene question fact genome escherichia coli occurred contaminant cdna libraries;22

Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger).

Herzog et al. (1993) cloned, sequenced, and mapped the human homolog of a proposed bovine NPY Y3 receptor reported by Rimland et al. (1991). The human cDNA clone was derived from a human lung cDNA library. The 1,670-bp sequence predicts a single open reading frame (ORF) of 352 amino acids, with 92% amino acid identity to the reported bovine sequence. The amino acid sequence shares features common to many other G protein-coupled receptors, including the 7-transmembrane regions and putative glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The receptor shows 36% identity to the interleukin-8 receptor (IL8RA; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146929"">146929</a>), which is located on chromosome 2, and to the angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/106165"">106165</a>), but only 21% identity to the NPY Y1 receptor.

The recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues involves interleukin-8 (IL8; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146930"">146930</a>) and several related chemotactic cytokines that attract and activate leukocytes. Loetscher et al. (1994) noted that these proteins are similar in size, have marked sequence similarities, and are characterized by 4 conserved cysteines that form 2 essential disulfide bonds. Two subfamilies are distinguished according to the arrangement of the first 2 cysteines, which are either adjacent (CC subfamily) or separated by one amino acid (CXC subfamily). The CXC cytokines activate primarily neutrophil leukocytes, while CC cytokines act on monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. These chemotactic agonists act via 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors, e.g., the 2 interleukin-8 receptors, IL8RA and IL8RB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146928"">146928</a>). Chemotactic cytokines of the CC subfamily do not bind to IL8 receptors. Loetscher et al. (1994) isolated from a human blood monocyte cDNA library a cDNA clone encoding a protein of 352 amino acids, corresponding to a receptor of the 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled type. They referred to the gene and the deduced protein as LESTR for 'leukocyte-derived seven-transmembrane domain receptor.' It shows 92.6% identity with a bovine neuropeptide Y receptor. In the monocyte library, LESTR cDNA fragments were about 20 times as frequent as cDNA coding for IL8RA and IL8RB, and much higher levels of mRNA specific for LESTR than for IL8R were found in human blood neutrophils and lymphocytes. Although the ligand for LESTR could not be identified among a large number of chemotactic cytokines, the high expression in white blood cells and the marked sequence relation to IL8RA and IL8RB suggested to Loetscher et al. (1994) that LESTR may function in the activation of inflammatory cells.

The human CD4 molecule (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186940"">186940</a>) acts as the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but CD4 supports viral entry into cells only when it is expressed on specific human cell types (Clapham et al., 1991). Weiner et al. (1991) and Dragic and Alizon (1993) presented evidence that the restriction of HIV-1 infection to certain human cell types is the result of a specific cofactor, encoded in the human genome, which is required for cell virus membrane fusion. Feng et al. (1996) undertook the isolation and characterization of the putative human HIV-1 fusion cofactor using an approach that made no assumptions about the mode of action of the cofactor other than that the cofactor would allow a CD4-expressing nonhuman cell to undergo viral fusion. They transfected CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells with a HeLa cell cDNA library and then incubated the transfected cells with an NIH 3T3 cell line expressing the HIV-1 Env gene (which is required by HIV-1 for fusion); transfected CD4+ cells that fused with Env-expressing cells could be distinguished by utilizing a lacZ biochemical marker specific to such fusion products. Feng et al. (1996) isolated a 1.7-kb human cDNA clone that allowed the CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells to undergo fusion. The cDNA contained a 352-codon ORF whose predicted amino acid sequence has 7 predicted transmembrane segments and resembles that of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The predicted molecular weight of the protein is 39,745 Da and its primary sequence includes 2 potential N-linked glycosylation sites.

An approximately 4-kb SNCAIP transcript was detected in many human tissues by Northern blot analysis and was particularly enriched in brain, heart, and placenta. Synphilin-1 was present in many regions in brain, including substantia nigra.

GATA6_SNP;0.0010529514713253;GATA6;"GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 6; GATA6";live;"GATA factors constitute a family of transcriptional regulatory proteins expressed with distinct developmental and tissue-specific profiles and are thought to regulate cell-restricted programs of gene expression. Suzuki et al. (1996) described the molecular cloning, chromosomal location, and the transcription of the human GATA6 gene. The cDNA encodes a predicted 449-amino acid protein that is highly conserved among vertebrates and includes 2 adjacent zinc finger/basic domains characteristic of the GATA factor family. The gene is transcribed in a pattern overlapping that of GATA4 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600576"">600576</a>). Transcripts for both of these genes are prominent in heart, pancreas, and ovary, but only GATA6 mRNA was found in lung and liver. GATA6 transcripts were also detected in cultures of human and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. In these cells, GATA6 transcripts were downregulated when quiescent cultures were stimulated to proliferate in response to mitogen activation. The results demonstrate that GATA6 is subject to both tissue-specific and mitogen-responsive regulatory signals. Suzuki et al. (1996) commented that GATA6 is a prime candidate for a gene that regulates the differentiative state of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Maitra et al. (2010) performed in situ hybridization in wildtype mouse embryos at embryonic day 13.5 and observed higher levels of expression of GATA6 in the atrial and ventricular myocardium than in the atrioventricular valve leaflets. The highest levels of GATA6 expression were seen in the smooth muscle cells of the aorta and pulmonary artery, whereas lower levels were detectable in pulmonary valve leaflets.";gata factors constitute family transcriptional regulatory proteins expressed distinct developmental tissue specific profiles thought regulate cell restricted programs gene expression suzuki described molecular cloning chromosomal location transcription human gata gene cdna encodes predicted amino acid protein highly conserved among vertebrates includes adjacent zinc finger basic domains characteristic gata factor family gene transcribed pattern overlapping gata entry transcripts genes prominent heart pancreas ovary gata mrna found lung liver gata transcripts also detected cultures human rat vascular smooth muscle cells cells gata transcripts downregulated quiescent cultures stimulated proliferate response mitogen activation results demonstrate gata subject tissue specific mitogen responsive regulatory signals suzuki commented gata prime candidate gene regulates differentiative state vascular smooth muscle cells maitra performed situ hybridization wildtype mouse embryos embryonic day observed higher levels expression gata atrial ventricular myocardium atrioventricular valve leaflets highest levels gata expression seen smooth muscle cells aorta pulmonary artery whereas lower levels detectable pulmonary valve leaflets;-1
