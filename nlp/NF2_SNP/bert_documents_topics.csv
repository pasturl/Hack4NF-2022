Using the ALL1 SET domain as a probe, Prasad et al. (1997) cloned a novel gene, KMT2D, which they designated ALR (ALL1-related gene). The gene encodes a 5,262-amino acid protein containing a SET domain, 5 PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a long run of glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues (mostly leucine). They also detected an alternatively spliced form encoding 4,957 amino acids and lacking an N-terminal zinc finger and PHD finger. Analysis of ALR expression showed that its approximately 18-kb transcript is expressed, like ALL1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic cells, but not in liver. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of early mouse embryos indicated expression of a similar mouse gene in multiple tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern, Prasad et al.

RB1_SNP;0.0120544615854409;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al.

(1984) cloned a transforming gene from a chemically transformed human osteosarcoma-derived cell line and mapped it to 7p11.4-qter. Identity to all previously known oncogenes except ERBB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/131550"">131550</a>) was ruled out by the fact that they are encoded by other chromosomes; identity to ERBB is probably excluded by failure of direct hybridizations of the 2 probes. MET was the designation suggested by Cooper et al. (1984).

Dean et al. (1985) showed that MET is in the tyrosine kinase family of oncogenes. It appeared to be most closely related in sequence to the human insulin receptor and ABL oncogene.

From the sequence of MET cDNA, Park et al. (1987) concluded that this oncogene is a cell-surface receptor for a then unknown ligand. The c-Met protooncogene product is a receptor-like tyrosine kinase composed of disulfide-linked subunits of 50 kD (alpha) and 145 kD (beta). In the fully processed c-Met product, the alpha subunit is extracellular, and the beta subunit has extracellular, transmembrane, and tyrosine kinase domains as well as sites of tyrosine phosphorylation.

(1995) identified the BRCA2 gene by positional cloning of a region on chromosome 13q12-q13 implicated in Icelandic families with breast cancer (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/612555"">612555</a>). The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance. The authors speculated that knowledge of the evolutionarily divergent chicken Brca2 sequence may be useful in distinguishing sequence variants from mutations in the human BRCA2 gene.";wooster identified brca gene positional cloning region chromosome q q implicated icelandic families breast cancer entry candidate disease gene likely located kb interval centered around using yeast artificial chromosome p artificial chromosome contigs identify trapped exons within region wooster screened human fetal brain placental monocyte breast cancer cdna libraries identified cdna encoding amino acid protein suggested may represent entire gene northern blot analysis demonstrated expression normal breast epithelial cells placenta breast cancer cell line mcf tavtigian determined complete coding sequence exonic structure brca examined pattern expression composite brca cdna sequence assembled consisted bp include polyadenylation signal poly tail conceptual translation cdna revealed orf beginning nucleotide encoding protein amino acids signal sequence end terminus obvious membrane spanning regions highest levels expression observed breast thymus slightly lower levels lung ovary spleen tavtigian noted brca protein like brca protein entry highly charged roughly one quarter residues acidic basic connor described mouse brca gene sequenced cdna entire amino acid brca protein found like brca brca relatively poorly conserved humans mice approximately brca transcribed diverse range mouse tissues especially testis ovary midgestation embryo brca also expressed mammary gland apparently induced upon pregnancy pattern expression strikingly similar brca warren cloned characterized chicken brca gene gene organized similarly human brca gene compact chicken gene encodes protein amino acids poorly conserved mammalian brca proteins overall amino acid sequence identity human brca however certain domains much highly conserved indicating functional significance authors speculated knowledge evolutionarily divergent chicken brca sequence may useful distinguishing sequence variants mutations human brca gene;0

(2002) identified SEST2, which they designated HI95, as a gene upregulated in a glioma cell line maintained under hypoxic conditions for 16 hours. The full-length SEST2 cDNA encodes a deduced 480-amino acid protein predicted to be a compact globular domain protein composed predominantly of alpha-helical structures. SEST2 has several potential serine-threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, most of them located within the alpha helices. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.9-kb transcript expressed at low to moderate levels in most tissues examined. In vitro translation of the cDNA resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 60 kD.
