In general, however, mammalian PTPases can be subdivided into 1 of 2 broad categories: (1) transmembrane receptor PTPases that contain linked cytoplasmic catalytic domains, and (2) intracellular PTPases. Included within the latter category are 2 closely related mammalian intracellular PTPases whose sequences encode 2 tandem SRC homology 2 (SH2) domains that are located at the amino-terminal side of a single PTPase catalytic domain.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus.

Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

The predicted amino acid sequence of the kinase domain was sufficiently like the sequence of v-raf to suggest that PKS may encode a polypeptide with serine/threonine kinase activity. Mark et al.

Dean et al. (1985) showed that MET is in the tyrosine kinase family of oncogenes. It appeared to be most closely related in sequence to the human insulin receptor and ABL oncogene.

From the sequence of MET cDNA, Park et al. (1987) concluded that this oncogene is a cell-surface receptor for a then unknown ligand. The c-Met protooncogene product is a receptor-like tyrosine kinase composed of disulfide-linked subunits of 50 kD (alpha) and 145 kD (beta).

The probe detected rearrangement of the homologous DNA segment in leukemic cells and in follicular lymphoma cells with the t(14;18) chromosome translocation but not in other neoplastic or normal B or T cells. Tsujimoto et al. (1984) concluded that the probe identified the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18q21 that was unrelated to known oncogenes and may be important in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms with this translocation.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

Tsujimoto et al. (1985) found that their most specific probe hybridized to cellular DNA from hamster and mouse under stringent conditions, indicating that at least part of the BCL2 gene is conserved across mammalian species as are many cellular oncogenes.

<Subhead> BRAG1: A Spurious 'BCL2-related' Gene

Das et al. (1996) reported the isolation and molecular characterization of a novel Bcl2-related cDNA from a human glioma. They designated the gene BRAG1 for 'brain related apoptosis gene.' They gene showed extensive homology to the BCL2 family of genes. The gene was expressed in normal brain as a 4.5-kb transcript and as a 1.8-kb transcript in human gliomas, which suggested to the authors that it may be rearranged in these tumors. The open reading frame of the BRAG1 gene encoded a protein of 31 kD. Using a bacterial expression vector, Das et al. (1996) produced BRAG1 protein that was found to crossreact with a BCL2 monoclonal antibody, further suggesting structural and immunologic similarity to BCL2.

The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene.

Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Herzog et al. (1993) cloned, sequenced, and mapped the human homolog of a proposed bovine NPY Y3 receptor reported by Rimland et al. (1991). The human cDNA clone was derived from a human lung cDNA library. The 1,670-bp sequence predicts a single open reading frame (ORF) of 352 amino acids, with 92% amino acid identity to the reported bovine sequence. The amino acid sequence shares features common to many other G protein-coupled receptors, including the 7-transmembrane regions and putative glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The receptor shows 36% identity to the interleukin-8 receptor (IL8RA; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146929"">146929</a>), which is located on chromosome 2, and to the angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/106165"">106165</a>), but only 21% identity to the NPY Y1 receptor.

The recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues involves interleukin-8 (IL8; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146930"">146930</a>) and several related chemotactic cytokines that attract and activate leukocytes. Loetscher et al. (1994) noted that these proteins are similar in size, have marked sequence similarities, and are characterized by 4 conserved cysteines that form 2 essential disulfide bonds. Two subfamilies are distinguished according to the arrangement of the first 2 cysteines, which are either adjacent (CC subfamily) or separated by one amino acid (CXC subfamily). The CXC cytokines activate primarily neutrophil leukocytes, while CC cytokines act on monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. These chemotactic agonists act via 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors, e.g., the 2 interleukin-8 receptors, IL8RA and IL8RB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146928"">146928</a>). Chemotactic cytokines of the CC subfamily do not bind to IL8 receptors. Loetscher et al. (1994) isolated from a human blood monocyte cDNA library a cDNA clone encoding a protein of 352 amino acids, corresponding to a receptor of the 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled type. They referred to the gene and the deduced protein as LESTR for 'leukocyte-derived seven-transmembrane domain receptor.' It shows 92.6% identity with a bovine neuropeptide Y receptor. In the monocyte library, LESTR cDNA fragments were about 20 times as frequent as cDNA coding for IL8RA and IL8RB, and much higher levels of mRNA specific for LESTR than for IL8R were found in human blood neutrophils and lymphocytes. Although the ligand for LESTR could not be identified among a large number of chemotactic cytokines, the high expression in white blood cells and the marked sequence relation to IL8RA and IL8RB suggested to Loetscher et al. (1994) that LESTR may function in the activation of inflammatory cells.

The human CD4 molecule (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186940"">186940</a>) acts as the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but CD4 supports viral entry into cells only when it is expressed on specific human cell types (Clapham et al., 1991). Weiner et al. (1991) and Dragic and Alizon (1993) presented evidence that the restriction of HIV-1 infection to certain human cell types is the result of a specific cofactor, encoded in the human genome, which is required for cell virus membrane fusion. Feng et al. (1996) undertook the isolation and characterization of the putative human HIV-1 fusion cofactor using an approach that made no assumptions about the mode of action of the cofactor other than that the cofactor would allow a CD4-expressing nonhuman cell to undergo viral fusion. They transfected CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells with a HeLa cell cDNA library and then incubated the transfected cells with an NIH 3T3 cell line expressing the HIV-1 Env gene (which is required by HIV-1 for fusion); transfected CD4+ cells that fused with Env-expressing cells could be distinguished by utilizing a lacZ biochemical marker specific to such fusion products. Feng et al. (1996) isolated a 1.7-kb human cDNA clone that allowed the CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells to undergo fusion. The cDNA contained a 352-codon ORF whose predicted amino acid sequence has 7 predicted transmembrane segments and resembles that of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The predicted molecular weight of the protein is 39,745 Da and its primary sequence includes 2 potential N-linked glycosylation sites.

HGF_SNP;0.0015597808998498;HGF;"HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR; HGF";live;"Plasma from patients with fulminant hepatic failure contains a factor that stimulates the growth of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

This localization may occur by means of specific interactions between synaptic membrane proteins and a variety of anchoring or clustering molecules. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the intracellular C-terminal tail of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit (GRIN1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), Lin et al. (1998) isolated human brain cDNAs encoding a novel protein. The presumed full-length coding sequence encodes a predicted 1,642-amino acid protein containing many long coiled-coil regions throughout its length. Due to its coiled-coil structure, the authors named the protein 'yotiao,' after a popular Chinese breakfast food consisting of long strands of fried dough. The interaction of yotiao with NR1 is dependent upon the presence of the 37-amino acid region in the C-terminal tail of NR1 that is encoded by the alternatively spliced C1 exon cassette of NR1. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected an 11-kb yotiao transcript that was expressed abundantly in skeletal muscle and pancreas, to a lesser degree in heart and placenta, and modestly in brain. Immunohistochemical experiments indicated that yotiao is expressed in a somatodendritic pattern in neurons throughout the rat brain, with prominent expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The authors demonstrated that yotiao and NR1 are colocalized in rat brain. Yotiao is predominantly located at the neuromuscular junction in rat skeletal muscle. Biochemical studies showed that yotiao fractionates with cytoskeleton-associated proteins and with the postsynaptic density. Lin et al. (1998) concluded that yotiao is an NR1-binding protein that is potentially involved in the cytoskeletal attachment of NMDA receptors.

By overlay screening with RII (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/176910"">176910</a>), database searches, and PCR of a Jurkat T-lymphocyte expression library, Witczak et al. (1999) cloned AKAP9, which they designated AKAP450. The deduced 3,908-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 453 kD. The N-terminal 1,626 amino acids are identical to yotiao except for a 12-amino acid stretch not found in yotiao. The 2 proteins are alternatively spliced products of the AKAP9 gene. Northern blot analysis revealed a 12-kb transcript expressed in most tissues tested, with highest levels in kidney, intermediate levels in brain, heart, placenta, and lung, and low levels in skeletal muscle, liver, small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Prominent smearing suggested a high level of mRNA degradation. Hybridization with a more 3-prime probe revealed a transcript of about 8 kb that was prominently expressed in liver and kidney. Immunofluorescence localization showed staining of a single perinuclear dot in interphase HeLa cells and staining of 2 polarized dots in metaphase cells. Dual labeling of HeLa cells and Western blot analysis of purified centrosomes from a human lymphoblast cell line confirmed that AKAP9 localized to centrosomes. Western blot analysis revealed 4 distinct proteins in centrosome preparations, with the highest molecular mass protein migrating at about 450 kD.

Using the N-terminal region of protein kinase N (PKN; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601032"">601032</a>) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Takahashi et al. (1999) cloned a fragment of AKAP9, which they designated CGNAP. They obtained the full-length cDNA by screening neuroblastoma and HeLa cell cDNA libraries and by RACE of a hippocampus cDNA library. The deduced 3,899-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 452 kD. Takahashi et al. (1999) identified N- and C-terminal leucine zipper-like motifs and 2 central RII-binding motifs, as well as coiled-coil regions.

Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest expression of a 14.5-kb transcript in spleen, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Upon overexposure, low levels were also detected in brain, heart, liver, lung, and testis. All tissues showed smearing of the Akap9 transcript. RT-PCR detected Akap9 in brain and testis and in all germ cell stages examined.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Szala et al. (1990) cloned the cDNA for GA733-2 from an expression colorectal carcinoma cell cDNA library transfected into COS cells and immunoselected with the GA733 monoclonal antibody. The predicted 314-residue protein is processed to the mature antigen of 232 amino acids. The glycosylated protein is predominantly 40 kD, although other species are observed. The same cDNA was identified independently by Strnad et al. (1989) from the lung adenocarcinoma cell line UCLA-P3 and designated KSA. Likewise, Perez and Walker (1989) obtained the identical cDNA, which they designated KS1/4 antigen. GA733-2 is about 49% similar to GA733-1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137290"">137290</a>). Both GA733 antigens have similar hydropathy plots, which include 2 hydrophobic regions.
