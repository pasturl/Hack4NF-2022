Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

Herzog et al. (1993) cloned, sequenced, and mapped the human homolog of a proposed bovine NPY Y3 receptor reported by Rimland et al. (1991). The human cDNA clone was derived from a human lung cDNA library. The 1,670-bp sequence predicts a single open reading frame (ORF) of 352 amino acids, with 92% amino acid identity to the reported bovine sequence. The amino acid sequence shares features common to many other G protein-coupled receptors, including the 7-transmembrane regions and putative glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The receptor shows 36% identity to the interleukin-8 receptor (IL8RA; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146929"">146929</a>), which is located on chromosome 2, and to the angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/106165"">106165</a>), but only 21% identity to the NPY Y1 receptor.

The recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues involves interleukin-8 (IL8; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146930"">146930</a>) and several related chemotactic cytokines that attract and activate leukocytes. Loetscher et al. (1994) noted that these proteins are similar in size, have marked sequence similarities, and are characterized by 4 conserved cysteines that form 2 essential disulfide bonds. Two subfamilies are distinguished according to the arrangement of the first 2 cysteines, which are either adjacent (CC subfamily) or separated by one amino acid (CXC subfamily). The CXC cytokines activate primarily neutrophil leukocytes, while CC cytokines act on monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. These chemotactic agonists act via 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors, e.g., the 2 interleukin-8 receptors, IL8RA and IL8RB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146928"">146928</a>). Chemotactic cytokines of the CC subfamily do not bind to IL8 receptors. Loetscher et al. (1994) isolated from a human blood monocyte cDNA library a cDNA clone encoding a protein of 352 amino acids, corresponding to a receptor of the 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled type. They referred to the gene and the deduced protein as LESTR for 'leukocyte-derived seven-transmembrane domain receptor.' It shows 92.6% identity with a bovine neuropeptide Y receptor. In the monocyte library, LESTR cDNA fragments were about 20 times as frequent as cDNA coding for IL8RA and IL8RB, and much higher levels of mRNA specific for LESTR than for IL8R were found in human blood neutrophils and lymphocytes. Although the ligand for LESTR could not be identified among a large number of chemotactic cytokines, the high expression in white blood cells and the marked sequence relation to IL8RA and IL8RB suggested to Loetscher et al. (1994) that LESTR may function in the activation of inflammatory cells.

The human CD4 molecule (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186940"">186940</a>) acts as the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but CD4 supports viral entry into cells only when it is expressed on specific human cell types (Clapham et al., 1991). Weiner et al. (1991) and Dragic and Alizon (1993) presented evidence that the restriction of HIV-1 infection to certain human cell types is the result of a specific cofactor, encoded in the human genome, which is required for cell virus membrane fusion. Feng et al.

They transfected CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells with a HeLa cell cDNA library and then incubated the transfected cells with an NIH 3T3 cell line expressing the HIV-1 Env gene (which is required by HIV-1 for fusion); transfected CD4+ cells that fused with Env-expressing cells could be distinguished by utilizing a lacZ biochemical marker specific to such fusion products. Feng et al. (1996) isolated a 1.7-kb human cDNA clone that allowed the CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells to undergo fusion. The cDNA contained a 352-codon ORF whose predicted amino acid sequence has 7 predicted transmembrane segments and resembles that of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.

Non-onc intervening sequences were present in the human counterpart, which is rather highly conserved in mammalian evolution and probably plays a role in normal cell growth or differentiation. Allelic variation in the human onc HaMSV gene was identified. The transforming genes of retroviruses are derived from a group of cellular genes that are highly conserved evolutionarily. The relationship between viral transforming genes (collectively called v-onc) and their normal cellular counterparts (collectively called c-onc) is obviously of great scientific and medical interest.

By searching for hyaluronic acid-binding proteins in human plasma, Choi-Miura et al. (1996) identified, purified, and partially sequenced a novel protein, HABP2, which they called PHBP. By SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, they demonstrated that purified HABP2 has a molecular mass of 70 kD; under reducing conditions, HABP2 migrates as 50- and 17-kD polypeptides, indicating that HABP2 is a heterodimer whose subunits are joined by disulfide bonds. By screening a human liver cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the HABP2 amino acid sequence, they cloned HABP2. The deduced full-length 560-amino acid protein contains a signal peptide, 3 EGF domains, a kringle domain, and a serine protease domain. HABP2 has a calculated molecular mass of about 63 kD. Northern blot analysis indicated that HABP2 is expressed as 3.0- and 2.3-kb mRNAs in human kidney, liver, and pancreas.

Choi-Miura et al. (2001) found that after incubation of HABP2 purified from human plasma, the single 70-kD protein fragmented into a 50-kD N-terminal fragment and a 27-kD C-terminal fragment, and this was followed by cleavage of the 50-kD fragment into two 26-kD fragments and cleavage of the 27-kD fragment into 17- and 8-kD fragments. Because the purified protein contained no other detectable proteins and HABP2 has a typical serine protease domain, Choi-Miura et al. (2001) concluded that fragmentation of HABP2 was caused by autoproteolysis. They further determined that the single-chain form of HABP2 is a precursor, the 2-subunit structure is the active serine protease, and the 3- or 4-chain structures are inactive.

Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>).

Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development.

Furthermore, Fog and GATA1 synergistically activated transcription from a hematopoietic-specific regulatory region and cooperated during both erythroid and megakaryocytic cell differentiation. These findings indicated that Fog acts as a cofactor for GATA1 and provided a paradigm for the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression by GATA transcription factors.

By sequence analysis, Rao et al. (1987) identified 2 different ERG transcripts, ERG1 and ERG2. ERG2 differs from ERG1 by a splicing event that causes a frameshift resulting in an additional 99 amino acids at the N terminus. In vitro transcription and translation resulted in 2 polypeptides of approximately 41 and 52 kD. Rao et al. (1987) concluded that alternative sites of splicing and polyadenylation, together with alternative sites of translation initiation, allow synthesis of 2 ERG polypeptides.

Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. Imbalances in glutamatergic function have been implicated in neuronal death following ischemia, in hypoglycemia or anoxia, in epilepsy, and in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate actions are mediated by glutamate receptors which fall into 2 distinct classes: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels whose responses to selective agonists define the N-methyl-D-aspartate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxasole-4-propionate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138248"">138248</a>), and kainate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138245"">138245</a>) subtypes. Metabotropic glutamate receptors, such as GRM3, which are coupled through GTP-binding proteins to second-messenger pathways, can be involved in the stimulation of phospholipase C, the presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release, the closure of cation channels in retinal ON bipolar cells, and the modulation of adenylate cyclase.
