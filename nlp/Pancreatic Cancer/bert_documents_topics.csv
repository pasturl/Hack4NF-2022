Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation.

An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2. However, certain domains are much more highly conserved, indicating functional significance. The authors speculated that knowledge of the evolutionarily divergent chicken Brca2 sequence may be useful in distinguishing sequence variants from mutations in the human BRCA2 gene.";wooster identified brca gene positional cloning region chromosome q q implicated icelandic families breast cancer entry candidate disease gene likely located kb interval centered around using yeast artificial chromosome p artificial chromosome contigs identify trapped exons within region wooster screened human fetal brain placental monocyte breast cancer cdna libraries identified cdna encoding amino acid protein suggested may represent entire gene northern blot analysis demonstrated expression normal breast epithelial cells placenta breast cancer cell line mcf tavtigian determined complete coding sequence exonic structure brca examined pattern expression composite brca cdna sequence assembled consisted bp include polyadenylation signal poly tail conceptual translation cdna revealed orf beginning nucleotide encoding protein amino acids signal sequence end terminus obvious membrane spanning regions highest levels expression observed breast thymus slightly lower levels lung ovary spleen tavtigian noted brca protein like brca protein entry highly charged roughly one quarter residues acidic basic connor described mouse brca gene sequenced cdna entire amino acid brca protein found like brca brca relatively poorly conserved humans mice approximately brca transcribed diverse range mouse tissues especially testis ovary midgestation embryo brca also expressed mammary gland apparently induced upon pregnancy pattern expression strikingly similar brca warren cloned characterized chicken brca gene gene organized similarly human brca gene compact chicken gene encodes protein amino acids poorly conserved mammalian brca proteins overall amino acid sequence identity human brca however certain domains much highly conserved indicating functional significance authors speculated knowledge evolutionarily divergent chicken brca sequence may useful distinguishing sequence variants mutations human brca gene;-1

Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein. CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

RB1_SNP;0.0075050405080639;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

The 393-amino acid, 43.5-kD protein is most closely related in size and sequence to the product encoded by the byr1 gene of S. pombe. The Mek1 gene was highly expressed in murine brain.

Seger et al. (1992) cloned a cDNA encoding the human homolog of Mek1, symbolized MKK1 by them, from a human T-cell cDNA library. The predicted protein has a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. They also isolated a related cDNA, called MKK1b, that appears to be an alternatively spliced form of MKK1. Seger et al. (1992) detected a 2.6-kb MKK1 transcript by Northern blot analysis in all tissues examined.

Zheng and Guan (1993) also cloned a human cDNA corresponding to MEK1. They noted that the 393-amino acid protein shares 99% amino acid identity with murine Mek1 and 80% homology with human MEK2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601263"">601263</a>).

Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF.

The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site.

By SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, they demonstrated that purified HABP2 has a molecular mass of 70 kD; under reducing conditions, HABP2 migrates as 50- and 17-kD polypeptides, indicating that HABP2 is a heterodimer whose subunits are joined by disulfide bonds.

(2001) found that after incubation of HABP2 purified from human plasma, the single 70-kD protein fragmented into a 50-kD N-terminal fragment and a 27-kD C-terminal fragment, and this was followed by cleavage of the 50-kD fragment into two 26-kD fragments and cleavage of the 27-kD fragment into 17- and 8-kD fragments. Because the purified protein contained no other detectable proteins and HABP2 has a typical serine protease domain, Choi-Miura et al. (2001) concluded that fragmentation of HABP2 was caused by autoproteolysis. They further determined that the single-chain form of HABP2 is a precursor, the 2-subunit structure is the active serine protease, and the 3- or 4-chain structures are inactive.

Ullrich and Schlessinger (1990) distinguished 4 classes. One class is represented by the ERBB family (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164870"">164870</a>). A second class includes dimeric receptors such as the insulin receptor as well as several protooncogenes such as MET (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>) and ROS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165020"">165020</a>). A third class is characterized by the presence of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and by the interruption of the catalytic domain in 2 parts by a specific hydrophilic 'interkinase' sequence of variable length. This class includes the protooncogene FMS, which encodes the CSF1 receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), which corresponds to the 'white spotting' locus in the mouse, as well as 2 PDGF receptor genes (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>) and FLT1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165070"">165070</a>).

The mouse cDNA, Rad51d, isolated by screening EST databases with yeast RAD55 and human RAD51B amino acid sequences, encodes a predicted 329-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 35,260 Da. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of multiple transcripts of the Rad51d gene in all tissues examined. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from 7 mammalian species demonstrated that the RAD51D gene is conserved. Pittman et al. (1998) used the mouse nucleotide sequence to screen a human EST database and identified 2 RAD51D cDNA clones from human T-lymphocyte and placenta libraries; both cDNAs appeared to be variants of the mouse gene. The shorter cDNA represented an alternatively spliced product and excluded sequences corresponding to 2 exons in the mouse gene, one of which encodes the first ATP-binding motif. The longer cDNA skipped a single exon present in the mouse gene, resulting in a frameshift and a predicted truncated protein. The authors stated that if the frameshift is ignored, the full-length putative 289-amino acid protein shares 71% sequence identity with the predicted mouse protein, and the mouse and human RAD51D genes have 2 conserved ATP-binding domains similar to other RecA-related genes.

Cartwright et al. (1998) also isolated human and mouse RAD51L3, or R51H3, cDNAs. They found that the sequence of the predicted 328-amino acid human protein is 82% identical to that of mouse RAD51L3.

Duncan et al. (1994) purified a 70-kD FUSE-binding protein, or FBP, that is present in undifferentiated but not differentiated cells. FBP exhibited DNA binding specificity for the noncoding strand of the FUSE site in vitro. By PCR of human cell line cDNA with degenerate primers based on a partial FBP protein sequence, the authors isolated partial FBP cDNAs. They recovered additional cDNAs from several libraries and used them to assemble a full-length FBP cDNA sequence. The central region of the predicted 644-amino acid protein contains 4 copies of a repeat unit. In vitro binding assays with mutant protein constructs indicated that the third and fourth copies constituted the minimum single-stranded DNA-binding domain. Using potassium permanganate to probe DNA conformation in vivo, Duncan et al. (1994) determined that the pattern of sensitivity of genomic DNA was consistent with the binding of FBP to the noncoding strand of FUSE, which displaced the coding strand.

Herzog et al. (1993) cloned, sequenced, and mapped the human homolog of a proposed bovine NPY Y3 receptor reported by Rimland et al. (1991). The human cDNA clone was derived from a human lung cDNA library. The 1,670-bp sequence predicts a single open reading frame (ORF) of 352 amino acids, with 92% amino acid identity to the reported bovine sequence. The amino acid sequence shares features common to many other G protein-coupled receptors, including the 7-transmembrane regions and putative glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The receptor shows 36% identity to the interleukin-8 receptor (IL8RA; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146929"">146929</a>), which is located on chromosome 2, and to the angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/106165"">106165</a>), but only 21% identity to the NPY Y1 receptor.

The recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues involves interleukin-8 (IL8; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146930"">146930</a>) and several related chemotactic cytokines that attract and activate leukocytes. Loetscher et al. (1994) noted that these proteins are similar in size, have marked sequence similarities, and are characterized by 4 conserved cysteines that form 2 essential disulfide bonds. Two subfamilies are distinguished according to the arrangement of the first 2 cysteines, which are either adjacent (CC subfamily) or separated by one amino acid (CXC subfamily). The CXC cytokines activate primarily neutrophil leukocytes, while CC cytokines act on monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. These chemotactic agonists act via 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors, e.g., the 2 interleukin-8 receptors, IL8RA and IL8RB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146928"">146928</a>). Chemotactic cytokines of the CC subfamily do not bind to IL8 receptors. Loetscher et al. (1994) isolated from a human blood monocyte cDNA library a cDNA clone encoding a protein of 352 amino acids, corresponding to a receptor of the 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled type. They referred to the gene and the deduced protein as LESTR for 'leukocyte-derived seven-transmembrane domain receptor.' It shows 92.6% identity with a bovine neuropeptide Y receptor. In the monocyte library, LESTR cDNA fragments were about 20 times as frequent as cDNA coding for IL8RA and IL8RB, and much higher levels of mRNA specific for LESTR than for IL8R were found in human blood neutrophils and lymphocytes. Although the ligand for LESTR could not be identified among a large number of chemotactic cytokines, the high expression in white blood cells and the marked sequence relation to IL8RA and IL8RB suggested to Loetscher et al. (1994) that LESTR may function in the activation of inflammatory cells.

The human CD4 molecule (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186940"">186940</a>) acts as the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but CD4 supports viral entry into cells only when it is expressed on specific human cell types (Clapham et al., 1991). Weiner et al. (1991) and Dragic and Alizon (1993) presented evidence that the restriction of HIV-1 infection to certain human cell types is the result of a specific cofactor, encoded in the human genome, which is required for cell virus membrane fusion. Feng et al. (1996) undertook the isolation and characterization of the putative human HIV-1 fusion cofactor using an approach that made no assumptions about the mode of action of the cofactor other than that the cofactor would allow a CD4-expressing nonhuman cell to undergo viral fusion. They transfected CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells with a HeLa cell cDNA library and then incubated the transfected cells with an NIH 3T3 cell line expressing the HIV-1 Env gene (which is required by HIV-1 for fusion); transfected CD4+ cells that fused with Env-expressing cells could be distinguished by utilizing a lacZ biochemical marker specific to such fusion products. Feng et al. (1996) isolated a 1.7-kb human cDNA clone that allowed the CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells to undergo fusion. The cDNA contained a 352-codon ORF whose predicted amino acid sequence has 7 predicted transmembrane segments and resembles that of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.

The cellular composition of these flies resembled that of cancer patients who are chimeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic cells. One of the genes they identified was the 'large tumor suppressor' gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive proliferation and form large tumors in many tissues in mosaic adults. Mutants homozygous for various lats alleles display a range of developmental defects, including embryonic lethality. Although many tumor suppressors were identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it was not clear whether these fly genes were directly relevant to tumorigenesis in mammals.

Tao et al. (1999) isolated mammalian homologs of Drosophila lats. Human LATS1 and mouse Lats1 share 99% amino acid sequence identity in the C-terminal kinase domain; human LATS1 and fly lats share 74% amino acid sequence identity in this region. Northern blot analysis detected LATS1 expression in all fetal and adult tissues examined, with highest expression in adult ovary.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

Di Iorio et al. (2005) stated that the p63 gene generates 6 isoforms. The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter. For both transcripts, alternative splicing gives rise to 3 different C termini, designated alpha, beta, and gamma.

MAD and MAD-related proteins are important components of the serine/threonine kinase receptor signal transduction pathways. Eppert et al. (1996) cloned and characterized a member of this family, which they designated MADR2. The gene encodes a 467-amino acid protein that contains no common structural motifs known at that time. MADR2 shares high homology with MADR1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601595"">601595</a>) and significant homology with DPC4. They reported that MADR2 is rapidly phosphorylated by activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.

By RT-PCR of human erythroleukemia cell mRNA using primers based on conserved regions between the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans Sma genes, Nakao et al. (1997) cloned a SMAD2 cDNA. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitously expressed 3.4- and 2.9-kb SMAD2 transcripts. The encoded protein has a molecular mass of 58 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Baker and Harland (1996) identified the mouse Madr2 gene using a functional assay to clone mouse mesoderm inducers from Xenopus ectoderm. The mouse amino acid sequence is 46% identical to the human tumor suppressor DPC4. Madr2 was expressed widely in the mouse embryo (with the exception of heart and the tail bud) from embryonic days 6.5 to 10.5. Madr2 was found to be confined to the nucleus in the deep anterior cells of the second axis, whereas it was localized in the cytoplasm in the epidermal and more posterior cells. Because Madr2 localized to the nucleus in response to activin (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147290"">147290</a>) and because activin-like phenotypes were induced by overexpression of Madr2, Baker and Harland (1996) concluded that Madr2 is a signal transduction component that mediates the activity of activin.";riggins identified homolog drosophila mothers decapentaplegic mad gene also mothers dpp predicted amino acid polypeptide authors called jv shows maximal homology mad genes amino carboxy termini protein identity mad amino acids drosophila mad apparently acts downstream tgf beta receptor entry transduce signals members tgf beta gene family entry gene product shows identity amino acids another mad homolog dpc smad entry graff described family xenopus proteins homologous drosophila mad c elegans cem genes mad mad related proteins important components serine threonine kinase receptor signal transduction pathways eppert cloned characterized member family designated madr gene encodes amino acid protein contains common structural motifs known time madr shares high homology madr entry significant homology dpc reported madr rapidly phosphorylated activation tgf beta signaling pathway rt pcr human erythroleukemia cell mrna using primers based conserved regions drosophila mad c elegans sma genes nakao cloned smad cdna northern blot analysis human tissues detected ubiquitously expressed kb smad transcripts encoded protein molecular mass kd sds page baker harland identified mouse madr gene using functional assay clone mouse mesoderm inducers xenopus ectoderm mouse amino acid sequence identical human tumor suppressor dpc madr expressed widely mouse embryo exception heart tail bud embryonic days madr found confined nucleus deep anterior cells second axis whereas localized cytoplasm epidermal posterior cells madr localized nucleus response activin see entry activin like phenotypes induced overexpression madr baker harland concluded madr signal transduction component mediates activity activin;7

Allelic variation in the human onc HaMSV gene was identified. The transforming genes of retroviruses are derived from a group of cellular genes that are highly conserved evolutionarily. The relationship between viral transforming genes (collectively called v-onc) and their normal cellular counterparts (collectively called c-onc) is obviously of great scientific and medical interest. Chang et al. (1982) studied the Harvey and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses, 2 closely related rat-derived transforming retroviruses called v-Ha-ras and v-Ki-ras, respectively.

The 8 distinct metabotropic glutamate receptors that have been identified can be classified into 3 groups according to their sequence similarities, pharmacologic properties, and preferred signal transduction mechanism (Kuramoto et al., 1994).";glutamate major excitatory neurotransmitter mammalian central nervous system glutamatergic neurotransmission involved aspects normal brain function perturbed many neuropathologic conditions imbalances glutamatergic function implicated neuronal death following ischemia hypoglycemia anoxia epilepsy neurodegenerative disorders glutamate actions mediated glutamate receptors fall distinct classes ionotropic metabotropic receptors ionotropic glutamate receptors ligand gated ion channels whose responses selective agonists define n methyl aspartate e g entry alpha amino hydroxy methyl isoxasole propionate e g entry kainate e g entry subtypes metabotropic glutamate receptors grm coupled gtp binding proteins second messenger pathways involved stimulation phospholipase c presynaptic inhibition glutamate release closure cation channels retinal bipolar cells modulation adenylate cyclase distinct metabotropic glutamate receptors identified classified groups according sequence similarities pharmacologic properties preferred signal transduction mechanism kuramoto;20

Transcripts for both of these genes are prominent in heart, pancreas, and ovary, but only GATA6 mRNA was found in lung and liver. GATA6 transcripts were also detected in cultures of human and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. In these cells, GATA6 transcripts were downregulated when quiescent cultures were stimulated to proliferate in response to mitogen activation. The results demonstrate that GATA6 is subject to both tissue-specific and mitogen-responsive regulatory signals. Suzuki et al. (1996) commented that GATA6 is a prime candidate for a gene that regulates the differentiative state of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Maitra et al.

A number of sodium-dependent phosphate transporters have been identified. Although functionally related, these phosphate transporters are structurally distinct and can be broadly grouped into 3 subtypes based on sequence identity. Type 1 transporters, such as NPT1 (SLC17A1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/182308"">182308</a>), are found mainly in kidney and do not appear to be regulated by dietary phosphate levels. Type 2 transporters can be subdivided into 2 groups based on sequence similarity and tissue distribution. One group, which includes NaPi3 (SLC34A1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/182309"">182309</a>), consists of transporters that are found almost exclusively in the renal proximal tubule, whereas the second group consists of transporters that are more widely distributed. Type 3 transporters can also function as membrane receptors for primate retroviruses. By searching an EST database for cDNAs that show sequence similarity to NaPi3, Feild et al. (1999) identified a human small intestine cDNA encoding the novel phosphate transporter SLC34A2, which they named NaPi3B. They isolated a full-length SLC34A2 cDNA from both human small intestine and lung cDNAs. The deduced 690-amino acid SLC34A2 protein is a type 2 phosphate transporter.

HOXB13_SNP;0.0012188891741381;HOXB13;"HOMEOBOX B13; HOXB13";live;"Vertebrate HOX genes are clustered in 4 unlinked complexes in the genome (HOXA, HOXB, HOXC, and HOXD clusters). Each complex spans about 200 kb and contains 9 to 11 genes, transcribed from the same strand of DNA. The order of the HOX genes along the chromosome correlates with their expression along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo, suggesting that their organization is integral to their proper regulation. Members of the abdominal B (AbdB) subfamily of HOX genes exhibit posterior domains of expression, including the developing urogenital system, in vertebrates. It was thought that HOXB genes 10 through 13 had been lost in evolution. Using Southwestern screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zeltser et al. (1996) identified HOXB13, a novel member of the AbdB subfamily. Analysis of the cDNA revealed that the HOXB13 gene encodes a 284-amino acid protein, 2 residues shorter than the mouse protein, which was also characterized by Zeltser et al. (1996). The 60-amino acid homeodomain near the C terminus of HOXB13 shares 78 to 83% identity with HOX proteins in paralog group-13 of the AbdB subfamily; 6 of the amino acid differences from other members of this group represent conservative changes. Moreover, HOXB13 shares less than 60% identity with other AbdB-related genes. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, Zeltser et al. (1996) determined that Hoxb13 was expressed first in the tailbud of embryonic mice and subsequently in the hindgut, urogenital tract, and posterior extent of the spinal cord. It was not expressed in the secondary axes.

Zhang et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA encoding U2AF35. They showed directly the interaction between the 65-kD and 35-kD proteins. With anti-peptide antibodies, they showed that the proteins have the same intranuclear location in coiled bodies, subnuclear organelles first identified by light microscopy in 1903.";vitro experiments demonstrate pre mrna splicing begins assembly multicomponent complex pre mrna complex spliceosome contains types factors small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles snrnps proteins binding u snrnp entry pre mrna branch site requires addition u snrnp u snrnp entry least protein factors sf sf u snrnp auxiliary factor u af purified hela cell u af comprises polypeptides u af entry kd u af evolutionarily conserved copurifies u af zhang isolated cdna encoding u af showed directly interaction kd kd proteins anti peptide antibodies showed proteins intranuclear location coiled bodies subnuclear organelles first identified light microscopy;10

Chan et al. (1994) found the same oncogene when they generated an expression cDNA library from an ovarian carcinoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/167000"">167000</a>) line. They found, furthermore, that a single point mutation (see MOLECULAR GENETICS) was responsible for activation of transforming properties. While the cDNA clone possessed high transforming activity, the ovarian tumor genomic DNA, which contained the mutated TC21 allele, failed to induce transformed foci. Thus, expression cDNA cloning made it possible to identify and isolate a human oncogene that had evaded detection by conventional approaches.

Using X-gal staining and RT-PCR analyses, Larive et al. (2012) showed that Rras2 was expressed from early developmental stages to adulthood in mice. In adult mice, highest expression was in lung and testis, and lowest expression was in tongue, liver, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose.";tc oncogene member ras superfamily initially cloned human teratocarcinoma cdna library pcr methods using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding conserved region ras genes drivas chan found oncogene generated expression cdna library ovarian carcinoma entry line found furthermore single point mutation see molecular genetics responsible activation transforming properties cdna clone possessed high transforming activity ovarian tumor genomic dna contained mutated tc allele failed induce transformed foci thus expression cdna cloning made possible identify isolate human oncogene evaded detection conventional approaches using x gal staining rt pcr analyses larive showed rras expressed early developmental stages adulthood mice adult mice highest expression lung testis lowest expression tongue liver skeletal muscle brown adipose;12

Northern blot analysis revealed that a 6.9-kb transcript was more abundant during embryonic development, whereas a 5.7-kb transcript was more abundant during postnatal development and in the adult. In situ hybridization revealed that RPTPS mRNA was widely expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system during embryonic development.
