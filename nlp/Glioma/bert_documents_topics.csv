<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Di Fiore et al. (1987) indicated that NEU and HER2 are both the same as ERBB2.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

(1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig. The gene produces a 4.7-kb transcript that encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein consisting of 928 amino acids.";dryja cloned dna fragments chromosome three identified rflps region q q contains retinoblastoma entry locus friend isolated cdna detects chromosomal segment properties gene retinoblastoma locus gene found expressed many tumor types rna transcript found retinoblastomas osteosarcomas locus spanned least kb dna friend started kb dna sequence could detect deletions involving q retinoblastomas used chromosome walking techniques isolate map kb surrounding genomic dna one single copy fragments recognized dna sequence mouse genome also human chromosome conservation dna sequence mouse humans suggested cloned fragment contained coding exon gene therefore tested ability fragment hybridize rna derived retinoblastoma cells human retinal cells found indeed recognized kb rna transcript retinal cell line transcript detectable retinoblastomas outlined cavenee cdna described friend used probe screen rna samples different tumor types shown hybridize tested except retinoblastomas retinoblastoma associated osteosarcomas furthermore use cdna analyze genomic structure homologous locus retinoblastomas associated osteosarcomas showed somatically altered genomic loci alterations took form fragments altered mobility suggesting gene rearrangements underrepresented fragments suggesting heterozygous deletions missing fragments suggesting homozygous deletions since one homozygous deletions entirely contained within genomic locus homologous cdna probe suggested expressed gene indeed rb gene dryja isolated cdna fragment derived human retinal mrna detected locus within q often deleted retinoblastoma lee prepared rabbit antiserum rb protein studied horsthemke showed present cell lines expressing normal rb mrna detected retinoblastoma cell lines rb protein metabolically labeled p phosphoric acid indicating phosphoprotein biochemical fractionation immunofluorescence studies demonstrated protein located nucleus furthermore protein retained could eluted dna cellulose columns suggesting dna binding activity gene encoding messenger rna kb located proximity esterase entry identified lee retinoblastoma susceptibility gene basis chromosomal location homozygous deletion tumor specific alterations expression transcription gene abnormal retinoblastomas examined mrna detectable whereas others expressed variable quantities mrna decreased molecular size kb contrast full length rb mrna present human fetal retina placenta tumors neuroblastoma medulloblastoma sequence cdna clones indicated hypothetical protein amino acids whyte demonstrated da cellular protein one cellular targets implicated process transformation adenovirus e proteins fact product rb gene interaction formation stable protein protein complex first demonstration physical link oncogene antioncogene similar case made numerous disorders many common toguchida reported complete genomic sequence rb gene contained bp contig gene produces kb transcript encodes nuclear phosphoprotein consisting amino acids;12

Kim et al. (2002) reported that MTOR forms a stoichiometric complex with RAPTOR, an evolutionarily conserved protein with at least 2 roles in the MTOR pathway. They cloned the full-length cDNA for RAPTOR, which contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with 1,335 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 149 kD. A previously identified partial cDNA, KIAA1303 (Nagase et al., 2000), is contained within the RAPTOR cDNA. All RAPTOR homologs have a novel N-terminal domain the authors called RNC (RAPTOR N-terminal conserved) that consists of 3 blocks with at least 67 to 79% sequence similarity and is predicted to have a high propensity to form alpha helices. Following the RNC domain, all RAPTOR homologs have 3 HEAT repeats, which are followed by 7 WD40 repeats in the C-terminal third of the protein. Northern blot analysis showed that RAPTOR is expressed in all tissues in a pattern similar to that of MTOR, with the highest levels of both mRNAs in skeletal muscle, brain, kidney, and placenta.

Independently, Hara et al. (2002) also cloned the RAPTOR gene. They found that RAPTOR is a 150-kD MTOR-binding protein that also binds eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/602223"">602223</a>) and p70 S6 kinase-alpha (S6K1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608938"">608938</a>).

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter.

Members of the abdominal B (AbdB) subfamily of HOX genes exhibit posterior domains of expression, including the developing urogenital system, in vertebrates. It was thought that HOXB genes 10 through 13 had been lost in evolution. Using Southwestern screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zeltser et al. (1996) identified HOXB13, a novel member of the AbdB subfamily. Analysis of the cDNA revealed that the HOXB13 gene encodes a 284-amino acid protein, 2 residues shorter than the mouse protein, which was also characterized by Zeltser et al. (1996). The 60-amino acid homeodomain near the C terminus of HOXB13 shares 78 to 83% identity with HOX proteins in paralog group-13 of the AbdB subfamily; 6 of the amino acid differences from other members of this group represent conservative changes. Moreover, HOXB13 shares less than 60% identity with other AbdB-related genes. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, Zeltser et al. (1996) determined that Hoxb13 was expressed first in the tailbud of embryonic mice and subsequently in the hindgut, urogenital tract, and posterior extent of the spinal cord. It was not expressed in the secondary axes.

During the first 2 trimesters of development, wound healing occurs without scars. Using RT-PCR and sequencing of human fetal fibroblast mRNA, Stelnicki et al. (1998) identified 2 homeobox genes, PRX2 and HOXB13, as being differentially expressed during fetal versus adult wound healing. Both genes were expressed in proliferating fibroblasts and fetal dermis, but not in adult dermis. The protein sequence of HOXB13 differed from that reported by Zeltser et al.

(1984) derived a DNA clone that was specific for the t(14;18) translocation. The probe detected rearrangement of the homologous DNA segment in leukemic cells and in follicular lymphoma cells with the t(14;18) chromosome translocation but not in other neoplastic or normal B or T cells. Tsujimoto et al. (1984) concluded that the probe identified the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18q21 that was unrelated to known oncogenes and may be important in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms with this translocation.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

Tsujimoto et al. (1985) found that their most specific probe hybridized to cellular DNA from hamster and mouse under stringent conditions, indicating that at least part of the BCL2 gene is conserved across mammalian species as are many cellular oncogenes. Negrini et al. (1987) cloned the murine gene homologous to BCL2 in man.

<Subhead> BRAG1: A Spurious 'BCL2-related' Gene

Das et al. (1996) reported the isolation and molecular characterization of a novel Bcl2-related cDNA from a human glioma. They designated the gene BRAG1 for 'brain related apoptosis gene.' They gene showed extensive homology to the BCL2 family of genes. The gene was expressed in normal brain as a 4.5-kb transcript and as a 1.8-kb transcript in human gliomas, which suggested to the authors that it may be rearranged in these tumors. The open reading frame of the BRAG1 gene encoded a protein of 31 kD. Using a bacterial expression vector, Das et al. (1996) produced BRAG1 protein that was found to crossreact with a BCL2 monoclonal antibody, further suggesting structural and immunologic similarity to BCL2. In an erratum, the authors concluded that the gene in question was in fact from the genome of Escherichia coli and occurred as a contaminant in cDNA libraries.";cell line studied pegoraro showed translocations characteristic burkitt lymphoma see entry follicular lymphoma see entry respectively tsujimoto derived dna clone specific translocation probe detected rearrangement homologous dna segment leukemic cells follicular lymphoma cells chromosome translocation neoplastic normal b cells tsujimoto concluded probe identified bcl gene chromosome q unrelated known oncogenes may important pathogenesis b cell neoplasms translocation human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line cleary cloned cdnas bcl nucleotide sequence analysis showed kb bcl mrna potentially encodes kd protein homologous predicted epstein barr virus protein tsujimoto croce determined first exon bcl transcribed kb mrna exon contains splicing donor signal bcl mrna spliced second exon produce kb mrna kb mrnas code bcl alpha beta proteins respectively identical except c terminal portion tsujimoto found specific probe hybridized cellular dna hamster mouse stringent conditions indicating least part bcl gene conserved across mammalian species many cellular oncogenes negrini cloned murine gene homologous bcl man subhead brag spurious bcl related gene das reported isolation molecular characterization novel bcl related cdna human glioma designated gene brag brain related apoptosis gene gene showed extensive homology bcl family genes gene expressed normal brain kb transcript kb transcript human gliomas suggested authors may rearranged tumors open reading frame brag gene encoded protein kd using bacterial expression vector das produced brag protein found crossreact bcl monoclonal antibody suggesting structural immunologic similarity bcl erratum authors concluded gene question fact genome escherichia coli occurred contaminant cdna libraries;12

Sequence analysis predicted that the 316-amino acid type I transmembrane protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide; extracellular V- and C-like Ig domains with 4 conserved cysteine residues; a transmembrane region; and a 45-amino acid cytoplasmic tail.

By searching for hyaluronic acid-binding proteins in human plasma, Choi-Miura et al. (1996) identified, purified, and partially sequenced a novel protein, HABP2, which they called PHBP. By SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, they demonstrated that purified HABP2 has a molecular mass of 70 kD; under reducing conditions, HABP2 migrates as 50- and 17-kD polypeptides, indicating that HABP2 is a heterodimer whose subunits are joined by disulfide bonds. By screening a human liver cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the HABP2 amino acid sequence, they cloned HABP2. The deduced full-length 560-amino acid protein contains a signal peptide, 3 EGF domains, a kringle domain, and a serine protease domain. HABP2 has a calculated molecular mass of about 63 kD. Northern blot analysis indicated that HABP2 is expressed as 3.0- and 2.3-kb mRNAs in human kidney, liver, and pancreas.

Choi-Miura et al. (2001) found that after incubation of HABP2 purified from human plasma, the single 70-kD protein fragmented into a 50-kD N-terminal fragment and a 27-kD C-terminal fragment, and this was followed by cleavage of the 50-kD fragment into two 26-kD fragments and cleavage of the 27-kD fragment into 17- and 8-kD fragments. Because the purified protein contained no other detectable proteins and HABP2 has a typical serine protease domain, Choi-Miura et al. (2001) concluded that fragmentation of HABP2 was caused by autoproteolysis. They further determined that the single-chain form of HABP2 is a precursor, the 2-subunit structure is the active serine protease, and the 3- or 4-chain structures are inactive.

Thus, the finding that the homozygous Irs1 knockout mouse survives with only mild resistance to hypertension was surprising. This dilemma was provisionally resolved by the discovery by Sun et al. (1995) of a second IRS signaling protein in mouse. They purified and cloned a likely candidate from mouse myeloid progenitor cells and, because of its resemblance to IRS1, they designated it IRS2. Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

Identification of the gene came from study of a rat model in which the gene for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease mapped to rat chromosome 9 in a region of syntenic homology to a portion of the human chromosome 6 containing the locus for ARPKD. The PKHD1 open reading frame is 12,222 basepairs and encodes a protein of 4,074 amino acids. Ward et al. (2002) found that the PKHD1 transcript, approximately 16 kb long, is expressed at moderate levels in adult kidney and pancreas, with lower expression in liver. Moderate expression was also detected in fetal kidney. The large protein encoded by PKHD1 contains multiple copies of a domain, TIG, shared with plexins and transcription factors. It was thought that fibrocystin may be a receptor protein that acts in collecting duct and biliary differentiation.

Onuchic et al. (2002) identified several distinct PKHD1 transcripts containing unique combinations of exons. The transcript with the longest open reading frame encoded a deduced 4,074-amino acid integral membrane protein, which the authors designated polyductin. This protein has a 3,858-amino acid extracellular N terminus, a single transmembrane (TM) domain, and a short C terminus.

It also has multiple potential N-glycosylation sites, an RGD domain, and 3 putative cAMP/cGMP phosphorylation sites. The other PKHD1 gene products were predicted to fall into 2 broad groups: those that encode proteins containing the TM element, which are likely to be associated with the plasma membrane, and those that encode proteins lacking the TM domain, which are likely to be secreted.

Nuclear hormone receptors are conditional transcription factors that play important roles in various aspects of cell growth, development, and homeostasis by controlling expression of specific genes. Members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, which includes the 5 steroid receptors and class II nuclear receptors (see below), are structurally characterized by 3 distinct domains: an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain, a central DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal hormone-binding domain. Before the binding of hormone, steroid receptors, which are sometimes called class I of the nuclear hormone receptor family, remain inactive in a complex with heat-shock protein-90 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/140571"">140571</a>) and other stress family proteins. Binding of hormone induces critical conformational changes in steroid receptors that cause them to dissociate from the inhibitory complex, bind as homodimers to specific DNA enhancer elements associated with target genes, and modulate that gene's transcription. After binding to enhancer elements, transcription factors require transcriptional coactivator proteins to mediate their stimulation of transcription initiation (Hong et al., 1997).";ncoa gene encodes nuclear receptor coactivator aids function nuclear hormone receptors nuclear hormone receptors conditional transcription factors play important roles various aspects cell growth development homeostasis controlling expression specific genes members nuclear hormone receptor superfamily includes steroid receptors class ii nuclear receptors see structurally characterized distinct domains n terminal transcriptional activation domain central dna binding domain c terminal hormone binding domain binding hormone steroid receptors sometimes called class nuclear hormone receptor family remain inactive complex heat shock protein entry stress family proteins binding hormone induces critical conformational changes steroid receptors cause dissociate inhibitory complex bind homodimers specific dna enhancer elements associated target genes modulate gene transcription binding enhancer elements transcription factors require transcriptional coactivator proteins mediate stimulation transcription initiation hong;10

Herzog et al. (1993) cloned, sequenced, and mapped the human homolog of a proposed bovine NPY Y3 receptor reported by Rimland et al. (1991). The human cDNA clone was derived from a human lung cDNA library. The 1,670-bp sequence predicts a single open reading frame (ORF) of 352 amino acids, with 92% amino acid identity to the reported bovine sequence. The amino acid sequence shares features common to many other G protein-coupled receptors, including the 7-transmembrane regions and putative glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The receptor shows 36% identity to the interleukin-8 receptor (IL8RA; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146929"">146929</a>), which is located on chromosome 2, and to the angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/106165"">106165</a>), but only 21% identity to the NPY Y1 receptor.

The recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues involves interleukin-8 (IL8; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146930"">146930</a>) and several related chemotactic cytokines that attract and activate leukocytes. Loetscher et al. (1994) noted that these proteins are similar in size, have marked sequence similarities, and are characterized by 4 conserved cysteines that form 2 essential disulfide bonds. Two subfamilies are distinguished according to the arrangement of the first 2 cysteines, which are either adjacent (CC subfamily) or separated by one amino acid (CXC subfamily). The CXC cytokines activate primarily neutrophil leukocytes, while CC cytokines act on monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. These chemotactic agonists act via 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors, e.g., the 2 interleukin-8 receptors, IL8RA and IL8RB (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/146928"">146928</a>). Chemotactic cytokines of the CC subfamily do not bind to IL8 receptors. Loetscher et al. (1994) isolated from a human blood monocyte cDNA library a cDNA clone encoding a protein of 352 amino acids, corresponding to a receptor of the 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled type. They referred to the gene and the deduced protein as LESTR for 'leukocyte-derived seven-transmembrane domain receptor.' It shows 92.6% identity with a bovine neuropeptide Y receptor. In the monocyte library, LESTR cDNA fragments were about 20 times as frequent as cDNA coding for IL8RA and IL8RB, and much higher levels of mRNA specific for LESTR than for IL8R were found in human blood neutrophils and lymphocytes. Although the ligand for LESTR could not be identified among a large number of chemotactic cytokines, the high expression in white blood cells and the marked sequence relation to IL8RA and IL8RB suggested to Loetscher et al. (1994) that LESTR may function in the activation of inflammatory cells.

The human CD4 molecule (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186940"">186940</a>) acts as the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but CD4 supports viral entry into cells only when it is expressed on specific human cell types (Clapham et al., 1991). Weiner et al. (1991) and Dragic and Alizon (1993) presented evidence that the restriction of HIV-1 infection to certain human cell types is the result of a specific cofactor, encoded in the human genome, which is required for cell virus membrane fusion. Feng et al. (1996) undertook the isolation and characterization of the putative human HIV-1 fusion cofactor using an approach that made no assumptions about the mode of action of the cofactor other than that the cofactor would allow a CD4-expressing nonhuman cell to undergo viral fusion. They transfected CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells with a HeLa cell cDNA library and then incubated the transfected cells with an NIH 3T3 cell line expressing the HIV-1 Env gene (which is required by HIV-1 for fusion); transfected CD4+ cells that fused with Env-expressing cells could be distinguished by utilizing a lacZ biochemical marker specific to such fusion products. Feng et al. (1996) isolated a 1.7-kb human cDNA clone that allowed the CD4-expressing NIH 3T3 cells to undergo fusion. The cDNA contained a 352-codon ORF whose predicted amino acid sequence has 7 predicted transmembrane segments and resembles that of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The predicted molecular weight of the protein is 39,745 Da and its primary sequence includes 2 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The cDNA had in fact been cloned previously by Federsppiel et al. (1993) from a human fetal spleen cDNA library and was designated D2S201E.

FBP exhibited DNA binding specificity for the noncoding strand of the FUSE site in vitro. By PCR of human cell line cDNA with degenerate primers based on a partial FBP protein sequence, the authors isolated partial FBP cDNAs.

The central region of the predicted 644-amino acid protein contains 4 copies of a repeat unit. In vitro binding assays with mutant protein constructs indicated that the third and fourth copies constituted the minimum single-stranded DNA-binding domain. Using potassium permanganate to probe DNA conformation in vivo, Duncan et al.

The translocation involves the TCR-delta locus (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186810"">186810</a>) on 14q11 and also a transcribed sequence on 11p15. They found that the gene on 11p15 is normally expressed in rhombomeres of the developing hindbrain. The gene product, designated rhombosine or rhombotin, has 155 amino acids and no homology to any previously described protein.

Because human and mouse rhombotin are virtually identical in derived protein sequence, rendering it difficult to identify functionally important regions or motifs, Boehm et al. (1990) isolated and compared rhombotin sequences from disparate species. They showed a sequence that is highly homologous to that of human and mouse rhombotin in Drosophila DNA. This comparison and others suggested that rhombotin, which lacks a DNA-binding homeodomain, may belong to a new class of transcriptional regulators that modulate transcription via intermolecular competitive binding to certain DNA-binding transcription factors. The structure of the predicted rhombotin protein suggests that it consists of 2 tandemly arranged cysteine-rich regions, which were subsequently identified in 3 transcription factors appended to putative DNA binding and activation domains, wherein they were termed LIM domains. The function of LIM domains may be in protein-protein interaction. LIM domains show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Consistent with its close structural homology to the human gene, the mouse homolog Ttg1 maps to chromosome 7, distal to the beta-globin locus (Angel et al., 1993).

Boehm et al. (1991) isolated 2 homologs of the rhombotin gene. Rhombotin-2 (RBTN2; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180385"">180385</a>) is located close to the T-ALL breakpoint cluster region on 11p13. This was determined by mapping to chromosome 11 by hybridization to a somatic cell that contained only human chromosome 11 and thereafter by hybridizing the human rhombotin exon-2-specific probe to cosmid clones spanning about 100 kb around the T-ALL breakpoint cluster region. Rhom-2 in the mouse is similar to the human homolog. Boehm et al.

(1999) obtained a partial NAV3 clone, which they designated KIAA0938. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in adult and fetal brain and in adult ovary, lung, and testis. Weaker expression was detected in adult heart and spleen and in fetal liver, and little to no expression was detected adult skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, and kidney. NAV3 was expressed moderately in all specific brain regions examined, with highest level in amygdala.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA library, Coy et al. (2002) cloned NAV3, which they called POMFIL1. The deduced 1,902-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 205.3 kD. POMFIL1 contains 3 N-terminal hydrophobic domains, several phosphorylation and N-glycosylation sites, 3 ATP/GTP-binding A motifs (P loops), and coiled-coil structures. The C terminus of POMFIL1 is highly conserved with the C termini of POMFIL2 (NAV2; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607026"">607026</a>) and POMFIL3 (NAV1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/611629"">611629</a>) and shares significant homology with Unc53, a C. elegans protein involved in axon guidance. Northern blot analysis detected a 9-kb POMFIL1 transcript in adult and fetal brain, but not in other tissues examined. Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain and developing embryos showed that Pomfil1 was predominantly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system. Electron microscopy localized Pomfil1 at the outer nuclear membrane of neurons, and mutation analysis showed thatthat the N terminus of Pomfil1 was required for nuclear targeting.

Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. Imbalances in glutamatergic function have been implicated in neuronal death following ischemia, in hypoglycemia or anoxia, in epilepsy, and in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate actions are mediated by glutamate receptors which fall into 2 distinct classes: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels whose responses to selective agonists define the N-methyl-D-aspartate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxasole-4-propionate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138248"">138248</a>), and kainate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138245"">138245</a>) subtypes. Metabotropic glutamate receptors, such as GRM3, which are coupled through GTP-binding proteins to second-messenger pathways, can be involved in the stimulation of phospholipase C, the presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release, the closure of cation channels in retinal ON bipolar cells, and the modulation of adenylate cyclase.
