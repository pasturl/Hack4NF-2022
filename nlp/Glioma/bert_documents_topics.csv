Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

The cellular composition of these flies resembled that of cancer patients who are chimeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic cells. One of the genes they identified was the 'large tumor suppressor' gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive proliferation and form large tumors in many tissues in mosaic adults. Mutants homozygous for various lats alleles display a range of developmental defects, including embryonic lethality. Although many tumor suppressors were identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it was not clear whether these fly genes were directly relevant to tumorigenesis in mammals.

Tao et al. (1999) isolated mammalian homologs of Drosophila lats. Human LATS1 and mouse Lats1 share 99% amino acid sequence identity in the C-terminal kinase domain; human LATS1 and fly lats share 74% amino acid sequence identity in this region. Northern blot analysis detected LATS1 expression in all fetal and adult tissues examined, with highest expression in adult ovary.

RB1_DEL;0.007789231751321;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

A critical protein kinase lies upstream of MAP kinase and stimulates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinase. Crews et al. (1992) cloned a mouse cDNA, denoted Mek1 (for Map/Erk kinase-1) by them, that encodes a member of this protein kinase family. The 393-amino acid, 43.5-kD protein is most closely related in size and sequence to the product encoded by the byr1 gene of S. pombe. The Mek1 gene was highly expressed in murine brain.

Some PKs, referred to as mixed-lineage kinases (e.g., MAP3K9; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600136"">600136</a>), have features of both serine/threonine and tyrosine PKs.

Kim et al. (2002) reported that MTOR forms a stoichiometric complex with RAPTOR, an evolutionarily conserved protein with at least 2 roles in the MTOR pathway. They cloned the full-length cDNA for RAPTOR, which contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with 1,335 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 149 kD. A previously identified partial cDNA, KIAA1303 (Nagase et al., 2000), is contained within the RAPTOR cDNA.

Following the RNC domain, all RAPTOR homologs have 3 HEAT repeats, which are followed by 7 WD40 repeats in the C-terminal third of the protein. Northern blot analysis showed that RAPTOR is expressed in all tissues in a pattern similar to that of MTOR, with the highest levels of both mRNAs in skeletal muscle, brain, kidney, and placenta.

The probe detected rearrangement of the homologous DNA segment in leukemic cells and in follicular lymphoma cells with the t(14;18) chromosome translocation but not in other neoplastic or normal B or T cells. Tsujimoto et al. (1984) concluded that the probe identified the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18q21 that was unrelated to known oncogenes and may be important in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms with this translocation.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

Tsujimoto et al. (1985) found that their most specific probe hybridized to cellular DNA from hamster and mouse under stringent conditions, indicating that at least part of the BCL2 gene is conserved across mammalian species as are many cellular oncogenes. Negrini et al. (1987) cloned the murine gene homologous to BCL2 in man.

<Subhead> BRAG1: A Spurious 'BCL2-related' Gene

Das et al. (1996) reported the isolation and molecular characterization of a novel Bcl2-related cDNA from a human glioma. They designated the gene BRAG1 for 'brain related apoptosis gene.' They gene showed extensive homology to the BCL2 family of genes. The gene was expressed in normal brain as a 4.5-kb transcript and as a 1.8-kb transcript in human gliomas, which suggested to the authors that it may be rearranged in these tumors. The open reading frame of the BRAG1 gene encoded a protein of 31 kD. Using a bacterial expression vector, Das et al. (1996) produced BRAG1 protein that was found to crossreact with a BCL2 monoclonal antibody, further suggesting structural and immunologic similarity to BCL2. In an erratum, the authors concluded that the gene in question was in fact from the genome of Escherichia coli and occurred as a contaminant in cDNA libraries.";cell line studied pegoraro showed translocations characteristic burkitt lymphoma see entry follicular lymphoma see entry respectively tsujimoto derived dna clone specific translocation probe detected rearrangement homologous dna segment leukemic cells follicular lymphoma cells chromosome translocation neoplastic normal b cells tsujimoto concluded probe identified bcl gene chromosome q unrelated known oncogenes may important pathogenesis b cell neoplasms translocation human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line cleary cloned cdnas bcl nucleotide sequence analysis showed kb bcl mrna potentially encodes kd protein homologous predicted epstein barr virus protein tsujimoto croce determined first exon bcl transcribed kb mrna exon contains splicing donor signal bcl mrna spliced second exon produce kb mrna kb mrnas code bcl alpha beta proteins respectively identical except c terminal portion tsujimoto found specific probe hybridized cellular dna hamster mouse stringent conditions indicating least part bcl gene conserved across mammalian species many cellular oncogenes negrini cloned murine gene homologous bcl man subhead brag spurious bcl related gene das reported isolation molecular characterization novel bcl related cdna human glioma designated gene brag brain related apoptosis gene gene showed extensive homology bcl family genes gene expressed normal brain kb transcript kb transcript human gliomas suggested authors may rearranged tumors open reading frame brag gene encoded protein kd using bacterial expression vector das produced brag protein found crossreact bcl monoclonal antibody suggesting structural immunologic similarity bcl erratum authors concluded gene question fact genome escherichia coli occurred contaminant cdna libraries;22

Leukemias with translocations involving MLL possess unique clinical and biologic characteristics and are often associated with poor prognosis. MLL rearrangements are found in more than 70% of infant leukemias, whether the immunophenotype is more consistent with ALL or AML6, but are less frequent in leukemias from older children. MLL translocations are also found in approximately 10% of AMLs in adults, as well as in therapy-related leukemias, most often characterized as AML, that develop in patients previously treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors for other malignancies. More than 50 different MLL fusion partners have been identified. Leukemogenic MLL translocations encode MLL fusion proteins that have lost H3K4 methyltransferase activity.

Each complex spans about 200 kb and contains 9 to 11 genes, transcribed from the same strand of DNA.

Members of the abdominal B (AbdB) subfamily of HOX genes exhibit posterior domains of expression, including the developing urogenital system, in vertebrates. It was thought that HOXB genes 10 through 13 had been lost in evolution. Using Southwestern screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zeltser et al.

Analysis of the cDNA revealed that the HOXB13 gene encodes a 284-amino acid protein, 2 residues shorter than the mouse protein, which was also characterized by Zeltser et al. (1996). The 60-amino acid homeodomain near the C terminus of HOXB13 shares 78 to 83% identity with HOX proteins in paralog group-13 of the AbdB subfamily; 6 of the amino acid differences from other members of this group represent conservative changes.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

Di Iorio et al. (2005) stated that the p63 gene generates 6 isoforms. The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter.

By searching sequence databases with the extracellular regions of B7 family members, Chapoval et al. (2001) identified a cDNA encoding CD276, which they called B7H3, in a dendritic cell (DC) cDNA library. Sequence analysis predicted that the 316-amino acid type I transmembrane protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide; extracellular V- and C-like Ig domains with 4 conserved cysteine residues; a transmembrane region; and a 45-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular receptor-binding domain of B7H3 shares 27% and 25% identity with those of B7H1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/605402"">605402</a>) and B7H2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/605717"">605717</a>), respectively. Northern blot analysis detected highest expression of a 4.1-kb transcript in heart, liver, placenta, prostate, testis, uterus, pancreas, small intestine, colon, and lymphoid organs, with lower expression in brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung, and no expression in peripheral blood leukocytes. B7H3 expression was detected in most tumor cell lines tested.

Sun et al. (2002) identified a mouse homolog of B7H3. By probing an EST database using mouse B7h3, they identified a human B7H3 variant, which they termed B7H3b, that has a different N-terminal sequence. RT-PCR analysis detected wide expression of both B7H3 isoforms. B7H3b was the major isoform in all tissues examined except brain and placenta.

Using monoclonal antibodies reacting with monocyte-derived DCs, retroviral expression cloning, and flow cytometric analysis, Steinberger et al.

HGF_SNP;0.0021453574723869;HGF;"HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR; HGF";live;"Plasma from patients with fulminant hepatic failure contains a factor that stimulates the growth of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

(1996) cloned and characterized a member of this family, which they designated MADR2. The gene encodes a 467-amino acid protein that contains no common structural motifs known at that time. MADR2 shares high homology with MADR1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/601595"">601595</a>) and significant homology with DPC4. They reported that MADR2 is rapidly phosphorylated by activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.

By RT-PCR of human erythroleukemia cell mRNA using primers based on conserved regions between the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans Sma genes, Nakao et al. (1997) cloned a SMAD2 cDNA. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitously expressed 3.4- and 2.9-kb SMAD2 transcripts. The encoded protein has a molecular mass of 58 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Baker and Harland (1996) identified the mouse Madr2 gene using a functional assay to clone mouse mesoderm inducers from Xenopus ectoderm. The mouse amino acid sequence is 46% identical to the human tumor suppressor DPC4. Madr2 was expressed widely in the mouse embryo (with the exception of heart and the tail bud) from embryonic days 6.5 to 10.5. Madr2 was found to be confined to the nucleus in the deep anterior cells of the second axis, whereas it was localized in the cytoplasm in the epidermal and more posterior cells. Because Madr2 localized to the nucleus in response to activin (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147290"">147290</a>) and because activin-like phenotypes were induced by overexpression of Madr2, Baker and Harland (1996) concluded that Madr2 is a signal transduction component that mediates the activity of activin.";riggins identified homolog drosophila mothers decapentaplegic mad gene also mothers dpp predicted amino acid polypeptide authors called jv shows maximal homology mad genes amino carboxy termini protein identity mad amino acids drosophila mad apparently acts downstream tgf beta receptor entry transduce signals members tgf beta gene family entry gene product shows identity amino acids another mad homolog dpc smad entry graff described family xenopus proteins homologous drosophila mad c elegans cem genes mad mad related proteins important components serine threonine kinase receptor signal transduction pathways eppert cloned characterized member family designated madr gene encodes amino acid protein contains common structural motifs known time madr shares high homology madr entry significant homology dpc reported madr rapidly phosphorylated activation tgf beta signaling pathway rt pcr human erythroleukemia cell mrna using primers based conserved regions drosophila mad c elegans sma genes nakao cloned smad cdna northern blot analysis human tissues detected ubiquitously expressed kb smad transcripts encoded protein molecular mass kd sds page baker harland identified mouse madr gene using functional assay clone mouse mesoderm inducers xenopus ectoderm mouse amino acid sequence identical human tumor suppressor dpc madr expressed widely mouse embryo exception heart tail bud embryonic days madr found confined nucleus deep anterior cells second axis whereas localized cytoplasm epidermal posterior cells madr localized nucleus response activin see entry activin like phenotypes induced overexpression madr baker harland concluded madr signal transduction component mediates activity activin;-1

Thus, the finding that the homozygous Irs1 knockout mouse survives with only mild resistance to hypertension was surprising. This dilemma was provisionally resolved by the discovery by Sun et al. (1995) of a second IRS signaling protein in mouse. They purified and cloned a likely candidate from mouse myeloid progenitor cells and, because of its resemblance to IRS1, they designated it IRS2. Alignment of the sequences of IRS2 and IRS1 demonstrated a highly conserved N terminus containing a pleckstrin-homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved C terminus containing several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS2 is expressed in many cells, including tissues from the homozygous IRS1 knockout mouse. Sun et al. (1995) suggested that IRS2 may be essential for signaling by several receptor systems.

Expressed exclusively in the olfactory receptor neurons and their precursors, the Olf1 protein contains a new helix-loop-helix motif and functions as an apparent homodimer. They suggested that Olf1 may be the first member of a family of related proteins that may direct cellular differentiation in a variety of neuronal tissues.

Early B-cell factor (EBF) is a tissue-specific and differentiation stage-specific DNA-binding protein that participates in the regulation of the pre-B and B lymphocyte-specific MB1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/112205"">112205</a>) gene. Travis et al. (1993) purified the mouse Ebf protein from pre-B cells and found that it is composed of two 62- to 65-kD subunits. Hagman et al. (1993) determined partial amino acid sequences of Ebf and used them to isolate mouse pre-B-cell cDNAs encoding Ebf. The predicted 591-amino acid protein has 2 functional domains: an N-terminal cysteine-rich region essential for DNA binding, and a C-terminal dimerization region containing two 15-amino acid repeats with similarity to the dimerization domains of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. The calculated molecular mass of the encoded Ebf protein is 64.4 kD. The authors found that recombinant Ebf binds to DNA as a homodimer, forms complexes with the Mb1 promoter, and is a strong activator of transcription. Northern blot analysis detected multiple Ebf transcripts in pre-B- and early B-cell lines but not in other hematopoietic cells. S1 nuclease protection analysis of adult mouse RNAs showed high levels of Ebf expression in lymph node, spleen, and adipose tissues and low levels in several nonlymphoid tissues.

Mice lacking Ebf are unable develop B lymphoid cells (Lin and Grosschedl, 1995). Using 5-prime RACE and primer extension analysis, Smith et al.

By searching for hyaluronic acid-binding proteins in human plasma, Choi-Miura et al. (1996) identified, purified, and partially sequenced a novel protein, HABP2, which they called PHBP. By SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, they demonstrated that purified HABP2 has a molecular mass of 70 kD; under reducing conditions, HABP2 migrates as 50- and 17-kD polypeptides, indicating that HABP2 is a heterodimer whose subunits are joined by disulfide bonds. By screening a human liver cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the HABP2 amino acid sequence, they cloned HABP2. The deduced full-length 560-amino acid protein contains a signal peptide, 3 EGF domains, a kringle domain, and a serine protease domain. HABP2 has a calculated molecular mass of about 63 kD. Northern blot analysis indicated that HABP2 is expressed as 3.0- and 2.3-kb mRNAs in human kidney, liver, and pancreas.

Choi-Miura et al. (2001) found that after incubation of HABP2 purified from human plasma, the single 70-kD protein fragmented into a 50-kD N-terminal fragment and a 27-kD C-terminal fragment, and this was followed by cleavage of the 50-kD fragment into two 26-kD fragments and cleavage of the 27-kD fragment into 17- and 8-kD fragments. Because the purified protein contained no other detectable proteins and HABP2 has a typical serine protease domain, Choi-Miura et al. (2001) concluded that fragmentation of HABP2 was caused by autoproteolysis. They further determined that the single-chain form of HABP2 is a precursor, the 2-subunit structure is the active serine protease, and the 3- or 4-chain structures are inactive.

LMO1_SNP;0.0010387219444967;LMO1;"LIM DOMAIN ONLY 1; LMO1";live;"Boehm et al. (1988) and Greenberg et al. (1989) studied a previously identified translocation t(11;14)(p15;q11) associated with T cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/613065"">613065</a>). The translocation involves the TCR-delta locus (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/186810"">186810</a>) on 14q11 and also a transcribed sequence on 11p15. They found that the gene on 11p15 is normally expressed in rhombomeres of the developing hindbrain. The gene product, designated rhombosine or rhombotin, has 155 amino acids and no homology to any previously described protein.

Because human and mouse rhombotin are virtually identical in derived protein sequence, rendering it difficult to identify functionally important regions or motifs, Boehm et al. (1990) isolated and compared rhombotin sequences from disparate species. They showed a sequence that is highly homologous to that of human and mouse rhombotin in Drosophila DNA. This comparison and others suggested that rhombotin, which lacks a DNA-binding homeodomain, may belong to a new class of transcriptional regulators that modulate transcription via intermolecular competitive binding to certain DNA-binding transcription factors. The structure of the predicted rhombotin protein suggests that it consists of 2 tandemly arranged cysteine-rich regions, which were subsequently identified in 3 transcription factors appended to putative DNA binding and activation domains, wherein they were termed LIM domains. The function of LIM domains may be in protein-protein interaction. LIM domains show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Consistent with its close structural homology to the human gene, the mouse homolog Ttg1 maps to chromosome 7, distal to the beta-globin locus (Angel et al., 1993).

Boehm et al. (1991) isolated 2 homologs of the rhombotin gene. Rhombotin-2 (RBTN2; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180385"">180385</a>) is located close to the T-ALL breakpoint cluster region on 11p13. This was determined by mapping to chromosome 11 by hybridization to a somatic cell that contained only human chromosome 11 and thereafter by hybridizing the human rhombotin exon-2-specific probe to cosmid clones spanning about 100 kb around the T-ALL breakpoint cluster region. Rhom-2 in the mouse is similar to the human homolog. Boehm et al. (1991) identified a third rhombotin-like gene (RBTN3; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180386"">180386</a>) and determined that it is not situated on chromosome 11. It shows, however, 93% homology with rhombotin-2 and also encodes a LIM domain protein. It is not known whether the RHOM3 gene is associated with chromosomal abnormalities in leukemia.
