ATRX_SNP;0.0156828419028161;ATRX;"ATRX CHROMATIN REMODELER; ATRX";live;"Stayton et al. (1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

RB1_SNP;0.0087699501422172;RB1;"RB TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREPRESSOR 1; RB1";live;"Dryja et al. (1984) cloned DNA fragments from chromosome 13. Three of these identified RFLPs from region 13q12-q22, which contains the retinoblastoma (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/180200"">180200</a>) 'locus.'

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

(1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53.

CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

Each complex spans about 200 kb and contains 9 to 11 genes, transcribed from the same strand of DNA. The order of the HOX genes along the chromosome correlates with their expression along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo, suggesting that their organization is integral to their proper regulation. Members of the abdominal B (AbdB) subfamily of HOX genes exhibit posterior domains of expression, including the developing urogenital system, in vertebrates. It was thought that HOXB genes 10 through 13 had been lost in evolution. Using Southwestern screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zeltser et al. (1996) identified HOXB13, a novel member of the AbdB subfamily. Analysis of the cDNA revealed that the HOXB13 gene encodes a 284-amino acid protein, 2 residues shorter than the mouse protein, which was also characterized by Zeltser et al. (1996). The 60-amino acid homeodomain near the C terminus of HOXB13 shares 78 to 83% identity with HOX proteins in paralog group-13 of the AbdB subfamily; 6 of the amino acid differences from other members of this group represent conservative changes. Moreover, HOXB13 shares less than 60% identity with other AbdB-related genes. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, Zeltser et al.

The predicted amino acid sequence has 96% identity to mouse and a 40% identity to Drosophila ptc proteins. The human PTC protein is predicted to contain 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains and 2 large hydrophilic extracellular loops.

HFE_SNP;0.0010245143369943;HFE;"HOMEOSTATIC IRON REGULATOR; HFE";live;"El Kahloun et al. (1993) used a yeast artificial chromosome with a 320-kb insert of genomic DNA that included the major histocompatibility complex class I HLA-A gene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/142800"">142800</a>) to screen a human duodenal mucosa cDNA library. They isolated 7 cDNA clones that corresponded to 7 new non-class I structural genes. Since these genes were located within the hemochromatosis (HFE1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/235200"">235200</a>) candidate gene region, they referred to the genes as HCG (hemochromatosis candidate gene) I-VII. El Kahloun et al. (1993) concluded that HCG I, III, V, and VI are probably single-copy genes situated 180, 155, 140, and 230 kb, respectively, centromeric to HLA-A. There were several copies of the other 3 genes. Each of the genes was associated with a CpG/HTF island.

Using cDNA hybridization selection with a 320-kb YAC containing the HLA-A gene to screen a human duodenal cDNA library, Goei et al. (1994) isolated and characterized 10 novel gene fragments. Also in search of the HFE gene, Yaouanq et al. (1994) identified a zone of linkage disequilibrium which suggested that the HFE gene may reside within a 400-kb expanse of DNA between the locus they referred to as i97 and HLA-F (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/143110"">143110</a>). Totaro et al. (1996) generated a detailed 1.2-Mb physical and transcription map of 6p spanning the HLA class I region from HLA-E to approximately 500 kb telomeric of HLA-F. The localization of known genes was refined, and a new gene from the RNA helicase superfamily was identified. Overall, 14 transcription units in addition to the HLA genes were detected and integrated into the map. Thirteen cDNA fragments showed no similarity with known sequences, and could be candidates for hemochromatosis.

By linkage disequilibrium and full haplotype analysis of hereditary hemochromatosis patients, Feder et al. (1996) identified a 250-kb region more than 3 Mb telomeric of the MHC on chromosome 6 that is identical by descent in 85% of patient chromosomes. Within this region, they identified a gene, which they termed HLA-H, that encodes a predicted 343-amino acid protein related to the MHC class I gene family. The protein comprises a signal sequence, peptide-binding regions (alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains), a transmembrane region, and a small cytoplasmic portion. One of the most conserved structural features of MHC class I molecules in HLA-H are the 4 cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges in the alpha-2 and alpha-3 domains. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb major mRNA transcript in all tissues tested, except brain.

Searching for new human MHC class I related genes, Hashimoto et al. (1995) identified MHC-related protein-1 (MR1; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600764"">600764</a>) and a second gene, MR2. The HLA-H gene (HFE) reported by Feder et al. (1996) as a candidate gene for hereditary hemochromatosis turned out to be identical to the MR2 gene of Hashimoto et al. (1995). Hashimoto et al. (1997) isolated the murine homolog of this gene. It was found to be similar to its human counterpart with an overall predicted amino acid sequence similarity of approximately 66% and expression in various tissues as in human. An extra 8 amino acid residues between the alpha-1 and the alpha-2 domains in the mouse molecule compared to the human counterpart could be explained by the creation of the additional coding sequence from the intron.

Thenie et al. (2001) isolated an antisense transcript originating from the HFE gene locus. The RNA spans exon 1, exon 2, part of intron 1 of the HFE gene, and 1 kb upstream of it. The antisense transcript is polyadenylated, but displays no open reading frame, and appears to be expressed at low levels in all tissues and cell lines tested.

Huebner et al. (1988) found that the locus is discontinuous in human cells and is composed of 3 major genetic elements originating 5-prime to 3-prime from human chromosomes 5, 18, and 17. Nakamura et al. (1992) cloned transcripts from the chromosome 17 portion of TRE from a cDNA library of cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA from TRE-transfected NIH 3T3 tumor cells. They obtained a novel cDNA, the 5-prime part of which overlapped the TRE transcript, and named its locus of origin TRE2. The complete cDNA spans 8,201 bp and possesses an unusually long noncoding region and a translatable region with 2 open reading frames (ORF). In 1 cDNA clone, the presence of 2 insertion sequences suggested the possibility of alternative splicing. Transfection-tumorigenicity assays with the ORFs subcloned into expression vectors were positive for the ORF adjacent to the 5-prime noncoding region and negative for the second, downstream ORF. Analysis of the 786-amino acid sequence deduced from the 5-prime ORF predicted a highly hydrophilic protein with 2 charge clusters suggesting nucleic acid-binding properties. When used as a probe, the cloned sequence detected RNA transcripts in a wide variety of human cancer cells regardless of their lineage of origin from different tissues, but not in human cells from normal tissue.

Gene duplication and domain accretion are thought to be the major mechanism for the emergence of novel genes during evolution. Genomic sequence analysis has demonstrated extensive amplification events during the evolution of higher primates. Paulding et al. (2003) reported that the USP6 oncogene is derived from the chimeric fusion of 2 genes, USP32 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607740"">607740</a>) and TBC1D3 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607741"">607741</a>). USP32 is an ancient highly conserved gene, whereas TBC1D3 is derived from a recent segmental duplication that is absent in most other mammals and shows rapid amplification and dispersal through the primate lineage. The chimeric gene USP6 exists only in the hominoid lineage of primates and arose as recently as 21 to 33 million years ago, after proliferation of the TBC1D3 segmental duplication in the primate lineage. Paulding et al. (2003) determined that the full-length USP6 gene encodes a 1,406-amino acid protein. Amino acids 1 to 496 are derived from TBC1D3 and encompass a TBC domain. Amino acids 501 to 1406 are derived from USP32 and encompass a ubiquitin-specific protease domain. In contrast to the broad expression patterns of USP32 and TBC1D3, RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of USP6 is testis-specific, a pattern proposed for genes implicated in the emergence of reproductive barriers. The authors concluded that the sudden emergence of chimeric proteins, such as that encoded by USP6, may have contributed to hominoid speciation.";tre locus first isolated nih cells transfected human ewing sarcoma dna nakamura huebner found locus discontinuous human cells composed major genetic elements originating prime prime human chromosomes nakamura cloned transcripts chromosome portion tre cdna library cytoplasmic poly rna tre transfected nih tumor cells obtained novel cdna prime part overlapped tre transcript named locus origin tre complete cdna spans bp possesses unusually long noncoding region translatable region open reading frames orf cdna clone presence insertion sequences suggested possibility alternative splicing transfection tumorigenicity assays orfs subcloned expression vectors positive orf adjacent prime noncoding region negative second downstream orf analysis amino acid sequence deduced prime orf predicted highly hydrophilic protein charge clusters suggesting nucleic acid binding properties used probe cloned sequence detected rna transcripts wide variety human cancer cells regardless lineage origin different tissues human cells normal tissue gene duplication domain accretion thought major mechanism emergence novel genes evolution genomic sequence analysis demonstrated extensive amplification events evolution higher primates paulding reported usp oncogene derived chimeric fusion genes usp entry tbc entry usp ancient highly conserved gene whereas tbc derived recent segmental duplication absent mammals shows rapid amplification dispersal primate lineage chimeric gene usp exists hominoid lineage primates arose recently million years ago proliferation tbc segmental duplication primate lineage paulding determined full length usp gene encodes amino acid protein amino acids derived tbc encompass tbc domain amino acids derived usp encompass ubiquitin specific protease domain contrast broad expression patterns usp tbc rt pcr analysis showed expression usp testis specific pattern proposed genes implicated emergence reproductive barriers authors concluded sudden emergence chimeric proteins encoded usp may contributed hominoid speciation;0
