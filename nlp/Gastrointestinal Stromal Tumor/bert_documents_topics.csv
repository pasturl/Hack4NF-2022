Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity. Activity of p53 is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by mutation of the p53 gene itself or by loss of cell signaling upstream or downstream of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Bourdon, 2007; Vousden and Lane, 2007).";transcription factor p responds diverse cellular stresses regulate target genes induce cell cycle arrest apoptosis senescence dna repair changes metabolism addition p appears induce apoptosis nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes unstressed cells p kept inactive essentially actions ubiquitin ligase mdm entry inhibits p transcriptional activity ubiquitinates p promote degradation numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p activity notably phosphorylation acetylation several less abundant p isoforms also modulate p activity activity p ubiquitously lost human cancer either mutation p gene loss cell signaling upstream downstream p toledo wahl bourdon vousden lane;6

<Subhead> PDGFRA Fusion Genes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/608232"">608232</a>) is characterized by the presence of the BCR (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/151410"">151410</a>)/ABL (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/189980"">189980</a>) fusion gene, usually in association with a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Toguchida et al. (1993) reported the complete genomic sequence of the RB1 gene, which was contained in a 180,388-bp contig.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact.

A third class is characterized by the presence of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and by the interruption of the catalytic domain in 2 parts by a specific hydrophilic 'interkinase' sequence of variable length. This class includes the protooncogene FMS, which encodes the CSF1 receptor (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164770"">164770</a>), and KIT (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164920"">164920</a>), which corresponds to the 'white spotting' locus in the mouse, as well as 2 PDGF receptor genes (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173490"">173490</a>, <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173410"">173410</a>) and FLT1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165070"">165070</a>).

The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development.

These catenins are thought to work as connectors that anchor the E-cadherin to the cytoskeletal actin bundle through the cadherin cytoplasmic domain. Dysfunction of this adhesion complex causes dissociation of cancer cells from primary tumor nodules, thus possibly contributing to cancer invasion and metastasis. Herrenknecht et al. (1991) and Nagafuchi et al. (1991) isolated a murine cDNA encoding the 102-kD alpha-catenin (CAP102). Oda et al. (1993) cloned and sequenced human alpha-catenin.

(1992) showed that a human lung cancer cell line, PC9, which expresses E-cadherin but only a small quantity of abnormal-sized alpha-catenin, grew initially as isolated cells and then regained its cell-cell adhesion potential when transfected with alpha-catenin.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

HGF_SNP;0.0020208180647044;HGF;"HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR; HGF";live;"Plasma from patients with fulminant hepatic failure contains a factor that stimulates the growth of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF.

The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site.

The probe detected rearrangement of the homologous DNA segment in leukemic cells and in follicular lymphoma cells with the t(14;18) chromosome translocation but not in other neoplastic or normal B or T cells. Tsujimoto et al.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

Tsujimoto et al.

<Subhead> BRAG1: A Spurious 'BCL2-related' Gene

Das et al. (1996) reported the isolation and molecular characterization of a novel Bcl2-related cDNA from a human glioma. They designated the gene BRAG1 for 'brain related apoptosis gene.' They gene showed extensive homology to the BCL2 family of genes. The gene was expressed in normal brain as a 4.5-kb transcript and as a 1.8-kb transcript in human gliomas, which suggested to the authors that it may be rearranged in these tumors. The open reading frame of the BRAG1 gene encoded a protein of 31 kD. Using a bacterial expression vector, Das et al. (1996) produced BRAG1 protein that was found to crossreact with a BCL2 monoclonal antibody, further suggesting structural and immunologic similarity to BCL2.

By searching for hyaluronic acid-binding proteins in human plasma, Choi-Miura et al. (1996) identified, purified, and partially sequenced a novel protein, HABP2, which they called PHBP. By SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, they demonstrated that purified HABP2 has a molecular mass of 70 kD; under reducing conditions, HABP2 migrates as 50- and 17-kD polypeptides, indicating that HABP2 is a heterodimer whose subunits are joined by disulfide bonds. By screening a human liver cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the HABP2 amino acid sequence, they cloned HABP2. The deduced full-length 560-amino acid protein contains a signal peptide, 3 EGF domains, a kringle domain, and a serine protease domain. HABP2 has a calculated molecular mass of about 63 kD. Northern blot analysis indicated that HABP2 is expressed as 3.0- and 2.3-kb mRNAs in human kidney, liver, and pancreas.

Choi-Miura et al. (2001) found that after incubation of HABP2 purified from human plasma, the single 70-kD protein fragmented into a 50-kD N-terminal fragment and a 27-kD C-terminal fragment, and this was followed by cleavage of the 50-kD fragment into two 26-kD fragments and cleavage of the 27-kD fragment into 17- and 8-kD fragments. Because the purified protein contained no other detectable proteins and HABP2 has a typical serine protease domain, Choi-Miura et al. (2001) concluded that fragmentation of HABP2 was caused by autoproteolysis. They further determined that the single-chain form of HABP2 is a precursor, the 2-subunit structure is the active serine protease, and the 3- or 4-chain structures are inactive.
