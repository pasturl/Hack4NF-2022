Adherens junctions (AJs; also called the zonula adherens) are critical for the establishment and maintenance of epithelial layers, such as those lining organ surfaces. AJs mediate adhesion between cells, communicate a signal that neighboring cells are present, and anchor the actin cytoskeleton. In serving these roles, AJs regulate normal cell growth and behavior. At several stages of embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumor cell metastasis, cells form and leave epithelia. This process, which involves the disruption and reestablishment of epithelial cell-cell contacts, may be regulated by the disassembly and assembly of AJs. AJs may also function in the transmission of the 'contact inhibition' signal, which instructs cells to stop dividing once an epithelial sheet is complete (summary by Peifer, 1993).";beta catenin adherens junction protein adherens junctions ajs also called zonula adherens critical establishment maintenance epithelial layers lining organ surfaces ajs mediate adhesion cells communicate signal neighboring cells present anchor actin cytoskeleton serving roles ajs regulate normal cell growth behavior several stages embryogenesis wound healing tumor cell metastasis cells form leave epithelia process involves disruption reestablishment epithelial cell cell contacts may regulated disassembly assembly ajs ajs may also function transmission contact inhibition signal instructs cells stop dividing epithelial sheet complete summary peifer;17

(1995) noted that the noncatalytic domain shows a striking degree of sequence heterogeneity. In general, however, mammalian PTPases can be subdivided into 1 of 2 broad categories: (1) transmembrane receptor PTPases that contain linked cytoplasmic catalytic domains, and (2) intracellular PTPases. Included within the latter category are 2 closely related mammalian intracellular PTPases whose sequences encode 2 tandem SRC homology 2 (SH2) domains that are located at the amino-terminal side of a single PTPase catalytic domain.

(1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription.

Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/300012"">300012</a>). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression.

Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues.

Gibbons et al. (1997) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control.

Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus.

The candidate disease gene was likely to be located in a 600-kb interval centered around D13S171. Using yeast artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome contigs to identify trapped exons within that region, Wooster et al. (1995) screened human fetal brain, placental, monocyte, and breast cancer cDNA libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding a 2,329-amino acid protein, but suggested that it may not represent the entire gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression in normal breast epithelial cells, placenta, and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).

Tavtigian et al. (1996) determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 and examined its pattern of expression. The composite BRCA2 cDNA sequence assembled consisted of 11,385 bp, but did not include the polyadenylation signal or poly(A) tail. Conceptual translation of the cDNA revealed an ORF beginning at nucleotide 229 and encoding a protein of 3,418 amino acids. There was no signal sequence at the end of terminus, and there were no obvious membrane-spanning regions. The highest levels of expression were observed in breast and thymus, with slightly lower levels in lung, ovary, and spleen. Tavtigian et al. (1996) noted that the BRCA2 protein, like the BRCA1 protein (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/113705"">113705</a>), is highly charged; roughly one-quarter of the residues are acidic or basic.

Connor et al. (1997) described the mouse Brca2 gene. They sequenced cDNA for the entire 3,329-amino acid Brca2 protein and found that, like Brca1, Brca2 is relatively poorly conserved between humans and mice (approximately 60%). Brca2 was transcribed in a diverse range of mouse tissues, especially the testis, ovary, and midgestation embryo. Brca2 was also expressed in the mammary gland and was apparently induced upon pregnancy. The pattern of expression was strikingly similar to that of Brca1.

Warren et al. (2002) cloned and characterized the chicken Brca2 gene. The gene is organized similarly to the human BRCA2 gene, but is more compact. The chicken gene encodes a protein of 3,399 amino acids, which is poorly conserved with mammalian BRCA2 proteins, having only 37% overall amino acid sequence identity with human BRCA2.

Friend et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus. The gene was found to be expressed in many tumor types, but no RNA transcript was found in retinoblastomas or osteosarcomas. The locus spanned at least 70 kb of DNA. Friend et al. (1986) started with a 1.5 kb DNA sequence which could detect deletions involving 13q14 in 3 of 37 retinoblastomas. They then used chromosome walking techniques to isolate and map 30 kb of surrounding genomic DNA. One of the single-copy fragments recognized a DNA sequence in the mouse genome and also in human chromosome 13. The conservation of this DNA sequence between mouse and humans suggested that the cloned fragment contained a coding exon of a gene. Therefore, they tested the ability of this fragment to hybridize to RNA derived from retinoblastoma cells and from human retinal cells. They found that indeed it recognized a 4.7-kb RNA transcript in the retinal cell line but that this transcript was not detectable in 4 retinoblastomas.

As outlined by Cavenee (1986), when the cDNA described by Friend et al. (1986) was used as a probe to screen RNA samples from different tumor types, it was shown to hybridize to all of those tested except retinoblastomas and retinoblastoma-associated osteosarcomas. Furthermore, use of this cDNA to analyze the genomic structure of its homologous locus in 50 retinoblastomas or associated osteosarcomas showed that about 30% had somatically altered genomic loci. These alterations took the form of fragments of altered mobility (suggesting gene rearrangements), underrepresented fragments (suggesting heterozygous deletions), and missing fragments (suggesting homozygous deletions). Since one of the homozygous deletions was entirely contained within the genomic locus homologous to the cDNA probe, it was suggested that this expressed gene was indeed the RB1 gene.

Dryja et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA fragment derived from human retinal mRNA that detected a locus within 13q14 that is often deleted in retinoblastoma.

Lee et al. (1987) prepared a rabbit antiserum against the RB protein studied by Horsthemke et al. (1987) and showed that it was present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA but was not detected in 5 retinoblastoma cell lines. The RB protein can be metabolically labeled with (32)P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most of the protein is located in the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein was retained by and could be eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting a DNA binding activity.

A gene encoding a messenger RNA of 4.6 kb, located in the proximity of esterase D (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/133280"">133280</a>), was identified by Lee et al. (1987) as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of the gene was abnormal in all of 6 retinoblastomas examined: in 2, mRNA was not detectable, whereas 4 others expressed variable quantities of the mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The sequence of cDNA clones indicated a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids.

Whyte et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 105,000-Da cellular protein, which is one of the cellular targets implicated in the process of transformation by the adenovirus E1A proteins, is in fact the product of the RB1 gene. This interaction with the formation of a stable protein/protein complex was the first demonstration of a physical link between an oncogene and an antioncogene. A similar case can be made for numerous other disorders, many of which are more common.

Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. Imbalances in glutamatergic function have been implicated in neuronal death following ischemia, in hypoglycemia or anoxia, in epilepsy, and in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate actions are mediated by glutamate receptors which fall into 2 distinct classes: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels whose responses to selective agonists define the N-methyl-D-aspartate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138249"">138249</a>), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxasole-4-propionate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138248"">138248</a>), and kainate (e.g., <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/138245"">138245</a>) subtypes.

A second class includes dimeric receptors such as the insulin receptor as well as several protooncogenes such as MET (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>) and ROS (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165020"">165020</a>).

An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns, whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

Cools et al. (2003) demonstrated that idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607685"">607685</a>) is often caused by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in fusion of PDGFRA and FIP1L1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/607686"">607686</a>), a neighboring gene. The PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that transforms hematopoietic cells and is a therapeutic target of imatinib. Cools et al. (2003) identified the PDGFRA-FIP1L1 gene in 9 of 16 patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and in 5 of 9 patients with responses to imatinib that lasted more than 3 months. Relapse in one patient correlated with the appearance of a thr674-to-ile mutation in the PDGFRA gene (T674I; {173490.0008}) that conferred resistance to imatinib.";matsui identified genomic sequence cloned cdna novel receptor like gene pdgf receptor csf receptor family gene recognized kb transcript coexpressed normal human tissues kb pdgf receptor mrna characteristics new receptor different previously known one pdgfr entry matsui suggested existence genes encoding pdgf receptors interact distinct manner different pdgf isoforms may confer regulatory flexibility functional responses pdgf subhead pdgfra fusion genes chronic myeloid leukemia cml entry characterized presence bcr entry abl entry fusion gene usually association q q chromosomal translocation baxter reported identification cloning rare variant translocation q q patients cml like myeloproliferative disease unusual frame bcr pdgfra fusion mrna identified patients either bcr exon exon fused short bcr intron derived sequences turn fused part pdgfra exon sequencing genomic breakpoint junctions showed chromosome breakpoints fell bcr introns whereas chromosome breakpoints within pdgfra exon cools demonstrated idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome entry often caused interstitial deletion chromosome q resulting fusion pdgfra fip l entry neighboring gene pdgfra fip l gene constitutively activated tyrosine kinase transforms hematopoietic cells therapeutic target imatinib cools identified pdgfra fip l gene patients idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome patients responses imatinib lasted months relapse one patient correlated appearance thr ile mutation pdgfra gene conferred resistance imatinib;25

HGF_SNP;0.0051892566336648;HGF;"HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR; HGF";live;"Plasma from patients with fulminant hepatic failure contains a factor that stimulates the growth of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Gohda et al. (1988) purified HGF from a patient's plasma and showed that it has multiple forms with molecular mass between 76 and 92 kD. HGF consists of 2 chains, heavy and light, with molecular mass of 54 to 65 kD and 31.5 and 34.5 kD, respectively. These chains are linked together by disulfide bonds. Miyazawa et al. (1989) and Nakamura et al. (1989) sequenced cDNAs encoding HGF. The deduced sequence of the pre-pro-protein consisted of 728 amino acid residues. The sequence showed that the heavy and light chains are encoded by the same mRNA and are produced from a common translation product by proteolytic processing. The difference in deduced number of amino acid residues probably indicates that HGF is distinct from hepatocyte stimulatory factor (HSF), which is the same as interferon beta-2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/147620"">147620</a>).

Rubin et al. (1991) studied a mitogen derived from lung fibroblasts which, if not identical to HGF, is closely related to it. They showed that their human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen had a spectrum of targets including endothelial cells and melanocytes in addition to epithelial cells.

Gherardi and Stoker (1990) found that HGF is structurally similar, if not identical, to scatter factor, a molecule shown to stimulate the dissociation and scattering of epithelial cells. The sequence of HGF has about 35% identity to that of plasminogen (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/173350"">173350</a>) and the putative cleavage site of HGF is identical to that of plasminogen. A potent mitogen for hepatocytes, HGF is also known as hepatopoietin A (HBGA) (Szpirer et al., 1992).

Weidner et al. (1991) presented structural and functional evidence that human scatter factor (SF) and human HGF are identical proteins encoded by a single gene. Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is also coded by the same gene. The HGF cellular receptor gene, the MET oncogene (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/164860"">164860</a>), is located on 7q with the HGF gene. Thus, cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 may simultaneously overproduce both the factor and its receptor and acquire invasive properties through an autocrine mechanism. An increase in the copy number of chromosome 7 is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities observed in human malignant gliomas (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/137800"">137800</a>).

Schultz et al. (2009) determined that HGF shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. The authors stated that there are multiple isoforms of HGF. HGF isoform-1 encodes a preprotein that is cleaved into alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is composed of a hairpin loop follow by 4 N-terminal kringle domains, and the beta chain has homology to trypsin-like serine proteases but has no catalytic function. HGF isoform-2 encodes only 2 kringle domains, and HGF isoform-3 and isoform-4 are similar to 1 and 2, respectively, differing only in the use of alternate exon 5b splice acceptor site. Isoform-5 encodes only 1 kringle domain and utilizes the exon 5a acceptor site. Schultz et al.

From a human common acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Cleary et al. (1986) cloned cDNAs for BCL2. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that the 6-kb BCL2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26-kD protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein.

Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) determined that the first exon of BCL2 is transcribed into a 3.5-kb mRNA. This exon contains a splicing donor signal so that BCL2 mRNA is spliced to the second exon to produce a 5.5- and an 8.5-kb mRNA. The 5.5- and 3.5-kb mRNAs code for the BCL2 alpha and beta proteins, respectively, which are identical except for the C-terminal portion.

To identify genes whose transcription might be repressed during the genesis of neuroblastomas, Shtivelman and Bishop (1991) used subtractive cDNA cloning to detect genes expressed in human melanomas and pheochromocytomas but not in neuroblastomas. The first of these genes identified encoded the cell surface protein CD44 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/107269"">107269</a>), an integral membrane glycoprotein that is the principal receptor for hyaluronate on the cell surface. A second gene, originally designated PM227, attracted their attention because its expression appeared to be coordinated with that of CD44. Shtivelman et al. (1992) reported that PM227 encodes a protein whose exceptionally large size of 700 kD caused them to rename the gene AHNAK (meaning 'giant' in Hebrew). The amino acid sequence of AHNAK suggested secondary structure with a periodicity of 2.33 residues per turn. Individual chains could associate to form a 7- or 8-stranded barrel. The resulting structure would be a polyionic rod with length as great as 1.2 microns. Preliminary evidence indicated that the protein resides predominantly within the nucleus, but no function had been discerned. The highly conserved repeated elements were, for the most part, 128 amino acids long.

(1987) identified a gene, which they called glioma-associated oncogene (GLI), that is amplified more than 50-fold in a malignant glioma. The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/165230"">165230</a>). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development.

Allelic variation in the human onc HaMSV gene was identified. The transforming genes of retroviruses are derived from a group of cellular genes that are highly conserved evolutionarily. The relationship between viral transforming genes (collectively called v-onc) and their normal cellular counterparts (collectively called c-onc) is obviously of great scientific and medical interest. Chang et al. (1982) studied the Harvey and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses, 2 closely related rat-derived transforming retroviruses called v-Ha-ras and v-Ki-ras, respectively.

In situ hybridization of mouse embryos at 12.5 days postcoitum showed that Phf6 was most highly expressed in the embryonic central nervous system and at lower levels in other tissues. Very low levels remained present throughout the adult brain.

The dynein heavy chains (DHCs) are responsible for force production and ATPase activity and contain a highly conserved catalytic domain with 4 P-loop consensus motifs involved in nucleotide binding (Chapelin et al. (1997)). Two major classes of dyneins, axonemal and cytoplasmic, have been identified. See <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/603297"">603297</a>.

They referred to DNAH5 as HL1. Sequence analysis revealed that DNAH5 is an axonemal DHC and is homologous to rat DLP5.

Olbrich et al. (2002) obtained a full-length DNAH5 cDNA by PCR amplification of overlapping fragments from testis and trachea libraries and by RACE analyses. The composite transcript contained an open reading frame of 13,872 nucleotides, encoding a deduced 4,624-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis using a cDNA probe corresponding to mouse Dnah5, which shares 91% sequence identity to the human homolog, detected strong expression of a 14-kb transcript in lung and kidney and weaker expression in brain, heart, and testis. In situ hybridization to whole mouse embryos detected weak expression confined to the node from 7.0 to 8.25 dpc.

(1998) identified the USH2A gene and isolated the corresponding cDNA from a human retina cDNA library. The USH2A gene encodes a 1,551-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 171.5 kD. Northern blot analysis identified 3 mRNA transcripts of 6.5, 5.0, and 1.9 kb in the retina. Reverse transcriptase PCR identified expression of USH2A in human fetal cochlea, eye, brain, and kidney. The USH2A protein sequence contains laminin epidermal growth factor and fibronectin type III motifs, which are most commonly observed in proteins comprising components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrices and in cell adhesion molecules. In the eye, both Bruch membrane (a specialized basement membrane underlying the retinal pigment epithelium) and the interphotoreceptor cell matrix are rich in extracellular matrix proteins. Extracellular matrix proteins also play a fundamental role in the cochlea: COL1A2 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/120160"">120160</a>), COL2A1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/120140"">120140</a>), and COL3A1 (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/120180"">120180</a>) are highly expressed in the membranous labyrinth of the cochlea. In addition, both X-linked and autosomal forms of Alport syndrome (see <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/104200"">104200</a>) are caused by mutations in collagen type IV genes.

Weston et al. (2000) found a sequence difference in the USH2A gene, resulting in reduction of the total length of the encoded protein, which they designated usherin, from 1,551 to 1,546 amino acids.

Huang et al. (2002) isolated and characterized the mouse and rat orthologs of human USH2A. Like human USH2A, the mouse and rat genes are expressed primarily in retina and cochlea. Mouse Ush2a encodes a 161-kD protein that shows 68% identity and 9% similarity to the human USH2A protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of the mouse and rat proteins, like their human counterpart, contain a leader sequence, an amino-terminal globular domain, 10 laminin epidermal growth factor domains, and 4 carboxy-terminal fibronectin type III motifs. With in situ hybridization, the authors compared the cellular expression of the USH2A gene in rat, mouse, and human retinas. In all 3 species, Ush2a mRNA was expressed in cells of the outer nuclear layer of the retina, one of the target tissues of the disease. In the developing rat retina, Ush2a mRNA expression appeared in the neuroepithelium at embryonic day 17.

Van Wijk et al. (2004) identified novel exons in the USH2A gene and obtained evidence for alternative splicing. The putative 5,202-residue protein encoded by the longest open reading frame harbors, in addition to the known functional domains, 2 laminin G and 28 fibronectin type III repeats, as well as a transmembrane region followed by an intracellular domain with a PDZ-binding domain at its C-terminal end. Semiquantitative expression profile analysis suggested a low level of expression for both the long and the short isoform(s) and partial overlap in spatial and temporal expression patterns.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy in mouse retina, Liu et al.

The p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.

Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.

Di Iorio et al. (2005) stated that the p63 gene generates 6 isoforms. The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter. For both transcripts, alternative splicing gives rise to 3 different C termini, designated alpha, beta, and gamma.

PKs can be grouped based on sequence similarities and on specificity for the acceptor amino acid. Most PKs phosphorylate either serine/threonine or tyrosine. Some PKs, referred to as mixed-lineage kinases (e.g., MAP3K9; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600136"">600136</a>), have features of both serine/threonine and tyrosine PKs. All PKs have Src homology (SH) domains (see MAP3K11; <a href=""http://omim.org/entry/600050"">600050</a>). PKs can also be grouped as receptors or nonreceptors. Receptor PKs have a transmembrane region, an extracellular ligand-binding domain, and an intracellular catalytic domain.

By screening a human cerebellum cDNA library with a rat brain cDNA of unknown function, Sakuma et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel PK, MAP3K13, which they called LZK (leucine zipper-bearing kinase).

In comparison to controls, the level of DNA topoisomerase II, determined by unknotting of P4 phage DNA, was reduced substantially in 4 of these cell lines and to a lesser extent in the fifth. DNA topoisomerase I, assayed by relaxation of supercoil DNA, was found to be present at normal levels.

Tsai-Pflugfelder et al. (1988) determined the entire coding sequence of the human TOP2 gene.

Chung et al. (1989) sequenced human cDNAs that had been isolated by screening a cDNA library derived from a mechlorethamine-resistant Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Raji-HN2) with a Drosophila Topo II cDNA. They identified 2 classes of sequence representing 2 TOP2 isoenzymes, which have been named TOP2A and TOP2B (<a href=""http://omim.org/entry/126431"">126431</a>). The sequence of 1 of the TOP2A cDNAs is identical to that of an internal fragment of the TOP2 cDNA isolated by Tsai-Pflugfelder et al. (1988). Southern blot analysis indicated that the TOP2A and TOP2B cDNAs are derived from distinct genes. Northern blot analysis using a TOP2A-specific probe detected a 6.5-kb transcript in the human cell line U937. Antibodies against a TOP2A peptide recognized a 170-kD protein in U937 cell lysates. Chung et al.

They cloned the full-length cDNA for RAPTOR, which contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with 1,335 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 149 kD. A previously identified partial cDNA, KIAA1303 (Nagase et al., 2000), is contained within the RAPTOR cDNA.

Following the RNC domain, all RAPTOR homologs have 3 HEAT repeats, which are followed by 7 WD40 repeats in the C-terminal third of the protein.

These findings indicated that Fog acts as a cofactor for GATA1 and provided a paradigm for the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression by GATA transcription factors.

By database searching with the mouse Fog1 sequence as query, Freson et al. (2003) identified homologous human sequences. Using primers based on these sequences for RT-PCR and RACE, they cloned a full-length FOG1 cDNA from platelets and a megakaryocytic cell line. The deduced 1,006-amino acid protein shares 76% overall sequence identity with mouse Fog1; of the 9 zinc fingers in human FOG1, only numbers 4, 5, and 8 are not completely conserved. Northern blot analysis identified a 3.3-kb FOG1 transcript in 2 cell lines tested.

ZNF217 was found to be centrally located in the 260-kb common region of amplification, transcribed in multiple normal tissues, and overexpressed in all cell lines and tumors in which it was amplified and in 2 in which it was not. ZNF217 was predicted to encode alternatively spliced, Kruppel-like transcription factors of 1,062 and 1,108 amino acids, each having a DNA-binding domain containing 8 C2H2-type zinc fingers and a proline-rich transcription activation domain.
